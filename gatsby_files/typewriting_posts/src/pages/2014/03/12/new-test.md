A long time ago I proposed "<a href="http://typewriting.org/2010/01/13/Reality/#content">what exactly is reality?</a>" as a question I would later answer. More recently I wrote on the same topic "I don't know [...] I also don't really care." That was obviously not quite true, as here I am writing about it again. I think what was true was that I'm okay with not having a way to fully define reality. And I'm not only okay with the ambiguity of possibly being totally wrong about everything; I think it's a good thing.

I remember reading a long time ago <a href="http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/620163-the-more-i-learn-the-more-i-realize-how-much">a quote by Einstein</a> "The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don't know."and later hearing about what I think was probably <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect">the Dunning-Kruger effect</a>, an actual cognitive confirmation of what Einstein said. Ignorance really does breed overconfidence while knowledge grows understanding of how ignorant we really are. What we value isn't just knowing a lot in general, but specifically knowing enough to poke at the edges of what we don't know.

There's something uncomfortable about recognizing that the part we don't know just seems bigger and bigger the more we learn about it. But I think the alternative, the idea that we could figure it all out and just be done learning about the universe, sounds even worse. Maybe it's just the perspective of what I know now, but it's hard to imagine knowing everything without everything feeling really small and boring.
