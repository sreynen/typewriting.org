title: "How not to Provoke Imitation" 
---
<p>Jon Udell, who <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2004/11/17.html#a1116">basically created the genre of screencasts</a>, <a href="http://www.infoworld.com/article/05/02/11/07OPstrategic_1.html">once wrote</a>:</p><br><blockquote><p>Now that it's almost trivial to make and publish short screencasts, can we expose our software-tool-using behavior to one another in ways that *provoke imitation*, lead to mastery, and spur innovation? It's such a crazy idea that it just might work.</p></blockquote><br><p>Emphasis added because I just experienced the opposite effect. After watching <a href="http://common-lisp.net/movies/slime.mov">a screencast demonstrating SLIME</a>, or Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs, I have a much clearer idea of how much I want to use this technology: not at all.</p><br><p>Granted, I skimmed a lot of the *fifty-five minute</em<br>> video on creating a morse code translator (and they say Lisp isn't useful). But when the narrator says, fifty minutes in, "this example is so simple that I can just look at it, and I know exactly what is going on," I think it comes very close to a perfect definition of irony. And then at the end, when he tries to quit and everything goes haywire, it's just pure comedy. I laughed, I cried (almost), but I did not develop any desire whatsoever to imitate what I was watching. Much the opposite.</p><br><p><strong>UPDATE: Please read <a href="http://typewriting.org/2005/11/15/Other_Planetary_Damange/">this post</a> before commenting here.</strong> I didn't post myself on Planet Lisp, and I disclaim any implied understanding of or caring about Lisp that goes with showing up there.</p>
