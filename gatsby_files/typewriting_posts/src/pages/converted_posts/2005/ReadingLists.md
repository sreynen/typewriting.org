<p>Over two years ago <a href="http://typewriting.org/2003/07/26/ten_random_feeds/">I wrote</a> "i don't believe there are currently any newsreaders that allow users to subscribe to an OPML file." Over a year ago, <a href="http://typewriting.org/2004/07/23/dynamic_OPML/">I repeated</a> "i believe there are still no newsreaders that allow users to subscribe to an OPML file." I've mentioned this to NetNewsWire author Brent Simmons <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=2766">three</a> <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3066">times</a> <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=3071">now</a>. Still no subscribe-able OPML.</p><br><p>But now that <a href="http://www.reallysimplesyndication.com/2005/10/13#a1032">Dave Winer mentioned the idea</a>, it's being <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/CommentView.aspx?guid=c5039596-ca64-4604-b063-fda45ca5757b">discussed</a> <a href="http://dannyayers.com/archives/2005/11/21/other-subscriptions-and-format-dissipation/">more</a> <a href="http://nick.typepad.com/blog/2005/10/reading_lists_f.html">widely</a>, and I expect it will be implemented by the third anniversary of when I first mentioned it. *Sigh*. Trickle-down idea economics. Oh well. Better late than never.</p>
