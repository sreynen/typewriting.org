<p>You can now leave comments with limited HTML. Specifically, you can include the following tags: b, i, em, strong, q, blockquote, p, pre, and a. If you use a (the tag for links), your comment will not show up until I approve it. This is to keep the comments spam-free.</p><br><p>You can also now browse and subscribe to the weblog based on tags. If you're only interested in what I have to say about music, for example, you can subscribe to <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/tag/music/">the music tag</a>. Each post has a list of tags, and clicking on any of them will take you to the appropriate tag page.</p>
