I think <cite>Most of Mine</cite> (<a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/mp3s/scott_reynen/most_of_mine.mp3">MP3</a>, <a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/lyrics/scott_reynen/most_of_mine">lyrics</a>) is one of my best songs, if I do say so myself. Which makes it all the more embarrassing to admit that it was largely inspired by an episode of <cite>Will and Grace</cite>. It's the one where Harry Connick Jr's character and Grace are getting back together after he has cheated on her. That said, I hope the song has a bit more depth to it than a typical episode of <cite>Will and Grace</cite>.
