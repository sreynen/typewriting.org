<p><a href="http://disemployed.com/">disemployed</a> is reopen for job searches again. this time i'm focusing on small town jobs rather than the big search sites. i've also been starting with the general structure, which is pretty much done now. you can search jobs by keywords and locations, and subscribe to searches in the various XML formats or via email. now all it needs is the jobs. last time i started with the jobs, and the structure was sort of hacked together, so it was a lot of work to add more jobs. with a cleaner structure, it should be easier to add jobs now. that's the theory anyway. now it's time to see how it works in practice.</p>
