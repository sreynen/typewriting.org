<p>I was going to write a rant about terrible customer service I've experienced recently, but instead I present an orderly table of information about the three companies that have overcharged me in the past two months:</p><br><table border="1"><br>	<tr><br>		<th style="text-align: right;">Company:</th><br>		<th>Qwest</th><br>		<th>Sprint</th><br>		<th>aplus.net</th><br>	</tr><br>	<tr><br>		<th style="text-align: right;">Amount</th><br>		<td>~$60</td><br>		<td>~$250</td><br>		<td>$10.20</td><br>	</tr><br>	<tr><br>		<th style="text-align: right;">Hours spent resolving:</th><br>		<td>~15</td><br>		<td>~10</td><br>		<td>~2</td><br>	</tr><br>	<tr><br>		<th style="text-align: right;">Weeks from problem reported to problem solved:</th><br>		<td>6</td><br>		<td>8</td><br>		<td>1, so far</td><br>	</tr><br>	<tr><br>		<th style="text-align: right;">Level of disdain for company (1-10):</th><br>		<td>8</td><br>		<td>6</td><br>		<td>5 and rising</td><br>	</tr><br>	<tr><br>		<th style="text-align: right;">Lesson learned:</th><br>		<td>*Don't buy modems from broadband providers.* They're just selling a modem someone else made, so buy it from that someone else, who can reliably ship and support it.</td><br>		<td>*Go to a physical store to get help.* Customer service reps pretend to help, but don't. Sprint store employees don't pretend, because you know where to find them.</td><br>		<td>*Yell at people to get money.* I'm normally more passive aggressive, but a dozen hours on the phone brought me to the discovery that customer service reps are more eager to give refunds to an unpleasant customer.</td><br>	</tr><br></table><br><p>Okay, a bit of ranting at the end. If I could easily do so, I would drop my contract with all of these companies. But each provide a valuable communications service I can't conveniently find elsewhere.</p>
