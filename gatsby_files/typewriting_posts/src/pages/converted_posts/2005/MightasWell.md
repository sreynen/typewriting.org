<p>Last month <a href="http://typewriting.org/2005/09/22/Hedging_Against_the_Future/">I tried to write about the potential problems with making decisions to hedge against the future</a>. Joel Spolsky did this a lot better today in <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/SetYourPriorities.html">Set Your Priorities</a>:</p><br><blockquote><p>In fact when I thought about this later, I realized that for a long time, I had been doing dumb shit (that's a technical term) simply because I figured that eventually it would have to get done, so I might as well do it now.</p></blockquote><br><p>That's exactly what I've been doing, only not so much with software as with life. I'm not saying I've been making a lot of bad decisions, but I think maybe making good decisions for bad reasons.</p>
