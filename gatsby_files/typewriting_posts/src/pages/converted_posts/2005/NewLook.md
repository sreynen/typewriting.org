The weblog has been prettied up a bit. I'm going to do other sections one by one so I can check if the fixed width causes problems. Eventually, the whole site will look more or less like the weblog does now. The background is from <a href="http://squidfingers.com/patterns/">squidfingers</a>. The general look is from various styles at <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a>.
