title: "Hedging Against the Future" 
---
<p>This morning I did a bit of <a href="http://www.answers.com/rubbernecking">rubbernecking</a> at <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/45296">a disaster of a post on MetaFilter</a>. The post, since deleted, managed to violate multiple style guidelines in addition to supporting a moral framework that makes me ashamed to be human. The argument goes something like this: 1) poor people are lazy and 2) lazy people deserve to die.</p><br><p>Amidst various suggestions that this may be the worst post to ever disgrace MetaFilter (not without much competition), there was an interesting comment by <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/45296#1053601">delmoi</a>, who wrote <q>Anyway, the problem with poor people is that they're not lazy enough. Seriously. They work long hours at shit jobs to provide food for their kids and they're too proud to take advantage of government programs because it's 'un-American'</q>.</p><br><p>So I had laziness in mind as I rode my bike past a couple school kids. I started thinking about the future and how the kids were probably looking at me thinking how odd it is to ride a bike to work, yet I expect it will be much more common for their generation. And that's when I realized that *I ride my bike to work because I'm lazy*.</p><br><p>It's not the kind of laziness we commonly think of, sitting on the couch watching TV eating potato chips (though I do some of that too). It's a pre-emptive laziness, a <a href="http://www.hhhh.org/wiml/virtues.html">programmer's laziness</a>. And it's not just my bike riding that demonstrates this. Nearly everything I do is a hedge against the future.</p><br><p>I expect gas to be prohibitively expensive, so I bought a bike to prepare myself. I don't expect the world can keep up current meat consumption, so I became vegetarian to prepare myself. I think we're moving towards an economy of ideas, and away from agriculture, manufacturing, and service. So I'm a programmer to prepare myself. I expect a future with less wealth for everyone, so I'm frugal to prepare myself. *I'm basically living in the future I expect*.</p><br><p>Which makes me wonder what good all this preparedness is doing me. I wonder if I wouldn't be better off spending more time thinking about the present and less thinking about the future.</p>
