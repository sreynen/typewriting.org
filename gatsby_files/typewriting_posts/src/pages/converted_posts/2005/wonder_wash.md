<p>i just ordered myself a "<a href="http://www.laundry-alternative.com/washing.html">wonder wash</a>," a hand-operated pressure washing machine. i wasn't able to track down more than a couple online reviews of similar machines, and both suggested that the handle might fall off, though both seemed to continue using it after that happened. it's only $50, so i thought it was worth the risk. i'm hoping this will give me more flexibility with where and when i do my laundry, give me a reason to get some exercise, and maybe even help the environment a bit. i'll try to post some sort of review up here after i've used it a few times for anyone else considering buying one.</p><br><p>update: see <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2005-01-31&amp;title=wonder+wash+update">review</a>, as promised.</p>
