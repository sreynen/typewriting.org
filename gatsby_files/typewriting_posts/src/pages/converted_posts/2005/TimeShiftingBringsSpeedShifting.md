title: "Time Shifting Brings Speed Shifting"

Over the past few months I've made and eaten dinner while watching TV several times. It's a hectic experience. Tonight I am making and eating dinner while watching a TV show on DVD, and something occurred to me that maybe was obvious to everyone else. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_shifting">Time shifting</a> technology brings with it speed shifting, which is so much more valuable.<br>The best feature of a Tivo (which I don't own, though almost everyone else I know does) is not the much-discussed ability to skip commercials, but the simple pause button which allows you to stop the show and do other things without worrying about getting back to the TV in time to continue the show. I don't even need to eat dinner in front of the TV now, though I will because eating alone at the table is less activity than I can handle. But having a TV show with time shifting at least makes it easier to slow down, which I think will be increasingly valuable as life becomes more hurried. I, at least, find it much easier to tune out commercials than to tune out the voice in my head saying "hurry up or you'll miss the show."<br>I think Tivo should release a commercial touting the pause button of the Tivo and using <a href="http://www.seeklyrics.com/lyrics/Simon-And-Garfunkel/Feeling-Groovy-59th-St-Bridge-Song.html">Simon and Garfunkel's "Feeling Groovy"</a> as a soundtrack.
