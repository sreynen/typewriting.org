title: "Caps are the new lazy" 
---
<p>I'm using standard capitalization from here (or actually the previous post) on out. A few years ago I wrote about <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/?date=2002-12-06&amp;title=capitalization">my reasons for not capitalizing</a>: laziness. But these days I type enough in contexts outside of this weblog that it actually takes more effort to shift (no pun intended) myself into no-caps mode here.</p><br><p>This is sort of a mirror of my experience with hair. I ocassionally stop shaving or getting haircuts because I tire of the chores, but eventually the longer hair becomes more trouble than cutting it. I suspect there's some metaphor here for life in general, but I'm too lazy to formulate it properly.</p>
