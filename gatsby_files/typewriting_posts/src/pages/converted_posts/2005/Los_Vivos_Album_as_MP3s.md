title: "Los Vivos Album as MP3s"

<p><a href="http://www.losvivos.com/news.asp">Over on the Los Vivos website</a>, you can now download MP3 tracks of our first (and last) album of original songs. This is an album we were making to give to friends, family, and fans, as well as potential show locations. I sort of killed that last part by leaving the band before the album was complete. But they already have me replaced with a great guitarist, so I look forward to future Los Vivos shows, at which you will likely hear these MP3s, less my songs. I think the songs turned out pretty nice, and now they make a nice collectors item commemorating the Los Vivos that was.</p>
