<p>immediately after the presidential election, john kerry started acting like a candidate i would want to vote for. i had already voted for him, but it was a compromise for me, not something i did with excitement. so when he started talking about issues like <a href="http://www.johnkerry.com/petition/billsummary.php">expanded health care coverage for children</a> *after the election*, i wondered why. he was obviously trying to increase his viability for some future election, but if he thought health care or <a href="http://www.johnkerry.com/petition/rumsfeld2.php">firing rumsfeld</a> was a winning issue, why didn't he say so *before* he lost?</p><br><p>today i got an email from <a href="http://www.moveon.org/">moveon</a> that made it all clear to me. it turns out howard dean is almost certainly going to be the next chair of the democratic party, which was a wonderful surprise to me.  this means dean will play a large role in determining who runs on the democratic ticket in future elections, which means he will have a lot of influence over john kerry's political future. also today, <a href="http://www.johnkerry.com/email/0209.html">john kerry started pushing grassroots organizing of the democratic party</a>, which sounds strikingly similar to what howard dean was talking about <a href="http://www.democracyforamerica.com/features/2005/01/24/from_the_ground_up.php">two weeks ago</a> (and throughout his campaign). suddenly kerry looks like a cheap sellout who will exploit issues about which people care deeply solely for his own political gain. unless something convinces me i'm completely wrong about this, i'm not voting for john kerry again, even if his opponent is bush running for a third term.</p>
