I have an old titanium powerbook that I picked up by the screen too many times.  The hinges on the screen snapped, and the screen could no longer support its own weight.  I could rest the screen against something, and use it as a desktop, but it was no longer easily portable. I continued using it as a desktop for the last two years, and made up for the missing portability by buying an iBook, and then another.<br><img src="http://typewriting.org/image/article/content/framed_laptop.jpg" alt="framed laptop" style="float: left; margin: 10px 15px 10px 0;"/><br>Last month I saw <a href="http://www.grynx.com/index.php/projects/laptop-on-the-wall-walltop/">a tutorial for making a "walltop" computer from a laptop</a>. In the tutorial, the laptop is actually taken apart and jammed inside a frame not much bigger than its screen. That looks nice, but I'm not especially good at taking things apart (without destroying them), so I just put the whole laptop in the frame.  It turned out much nicer than I was expecting.<br>The laptop has a wireless card, so for most things, I can control it from another machine using <a href="http://www.redstonesoftware.com/vnc.html">OSX VNC</a> (server) and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cotvnc/">Chicken of the VNC</a> (client), both free applications. And in the few cases where I'll need to take it out, I just need to take it off the wall and turn a single piece of wood holding it in the frame. It's pretty ugly in the back, as my woodworking skills leave much to be desired. But I'm happy with my new digital picture frame.<br><div class="clear"></div>
