<p><a href="http://reilly.typepad.com/cameronreilly/2005/05/itunes_podcast_.html">iTunes willl support podcasts</a>. <a href="http://blog.del.icio.us/blog/2005/06/casting_the_net.html">del.icio.us has added postcasts for tagged MP3 content</a>. <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2005/06/23.html#a1256">Jon Udell is working on using del.icio.us tag overlap as a recommendation engine</a>. When these are all put together, we will have customized listening channels (internet radio without the ridiculous license fees), with the ability to broaden our listening horizons at whatever rate we choose. I'm looking forward to that.</p>
