There are about 400 geeks here running RSS readers that are pulling Slashdot's feed from behind the same IP address, as Slashdot's systems have interpreted this as one user repeatedly reloading it.</blockquote><br>Why didn't any of those 400 geeks at the Emerging Tech conference emerge some tech (e.g. a local cache) in the past year to prevent this problem?
