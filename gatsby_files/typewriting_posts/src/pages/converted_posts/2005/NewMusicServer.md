<p><a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/">music.randomchaos.com</a> is now being served from an iBook in my house, on a dynamic IP address at 7Mbps. This means everything on music.randomchaos.com will be slower, and occassionally it may go down altogether. In testing the system, I haven't noticed a big speed difference and it hasn't gone down once, but we'll see how it holds up under real traffic. On the positive side, I no longer have space limitations for the music, which means I can host as many songs as I want. It will also be easier to add new songs, as I can just stick them on my local iBook, and don't need to wait through slower FTP uploads. I hope this will result in my offering more music more often.</p>
