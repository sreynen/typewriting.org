<p>It seems all the cool kids are <a href="http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/2005/03/before_the_revolution.php">critiquing</a> and/or <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/03/21/ads-are-gone/">getting rid of</a> Google ads, but I'm holding out. I like the idea of targetted advertising, as it promises to add value to, rather than distract from content. For example, if I'm reading about a used Honda for sale, I would appreciate some links to companies selling related products, such as the used Honda parts ads I currently see on my <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/?date=2004-12-04&amp;title=car+for+sale">Honda sale post</a> (since sold). On the other side, of course, I like reducing my website expenses.</p><br><br><p>Shelley apparently had a problem with <a href="http://philringnalda.com/blog/2005/03/003347.php">oil rig ads showing up</a> in <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/03/15/save-anwr/">her post opposing drilling in ANWR</a>. I only wish my ads worked so well. Too many of my posts display ads for weblog tools. The navigational text on every page seems to be overpowering the actual content in Google's topic-determination algorhythm. I'm going to revamp my weblog so that post titles are more prominantly part of the URL, and descriptions are more descriptive. If this doesn't make my ads more relevant, I'll consider getting rid of them. But I'm defining relevancy liberally.</p><br><br><p>I don't mind when pro-Bush ads show up in my anti-Bush posts. That's related, if ironically so. I have a faith that knowledge is ultimately good. That's why I regularly read authors with whom I regularly disagree. If I'm interested in an issue, I'm also interested in dissenting opinions on that issue. So this doesn't bother me as it apparently does others.</p><br><br><p>Nor do I think the internet is succeptable to the same corruption as the real world, as Jonathon implies when he writes <q>I can hardly bear to watch as the Talleyrands corrupt something that was, for a while, magical.</q> In the real world the corrupt have the power to change the rules for everyone else. Talleyrand, for example, used his power working under Napoleon to kill people. But the internet's structure makes analogous activities impossible. Not only could you not possibly kill me via the internet, but you can't even make me read something I find uninteresting. Every online transaction requires consent by everyone involved. If I don't want you reading my website, I can tell my server to stop responding to requests from you (so long as I can identify you). That's what makes <a href="http://business.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,9071-1535913,00.html">AFP's lawsuit against Google</a> ridiculous.</p><br><img src="http://typewriting.org/image/article/content/tornado_warning.gif" alt="tornado" width="200" height="200" style="	float: right; margin: 2px 0px 2px 5px;"/><br><p>Likewise, if you don't want to see my ads, you can install <a href="http://dunck.us/collab/GreaseMonkeyUserScripts">a Greasemonkey script to block these ads</a>, as Jonathon did. The only problem is that those who, like me, find the ads occassionally valuable don't currently have the option of adding them where they don't exist. So we are losing what to us is useful functionality when these ads are taken away. But I'm not about to tell, or even ask, website owners to add Google ads just to make me happy. Why would I, when I can do it myself?</p><br><p>I made my first Greasemonkey script, <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/software/firefox/greasemonkey/aga/">Add Google Ads</a>, which adds Google ads to the top of every page (requires Firefox and Greasemonkey). For the curious, Jonathon's anti-Google ad post has Google ads for "Free Instant Ordination" and "Abbott Church Goods," while Shelley's has ads for "Directional Drilling" and "Rotary Steerable Tools." Hmm ... maybe this isn't as useful as I had thought it would be.</p><br><p>As they say, it don't take <a href="http://www.weather.com/">weather.com</a> to see which way the wind blows. But what makes the internet magical for me is all the counter-currents. You can remove ads from my site, I can add ads to yours, and we can all be happy in this tornado.</p>
