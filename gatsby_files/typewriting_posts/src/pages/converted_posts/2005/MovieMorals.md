<a href="http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,4120,1667600,00.html">The Guardian</a>: <q>the moral of King Kong is simpler still: "Don't pick a fight with nature."</q> <a href="http://ezrakilty.net/ezlog/archives/000831.html">Letters to an Unknown Audience</a>: <q>The message of <cite>Narnia</cite> is clear: Don't ask questions. Trust the first person you meet and stick with it. Raise your ill-begotten sword for it.</q> I haven't seen either, but I'm curious to what extent these morals are injected by the films' creators vs. viewers. I also think it would be an interesting thesis project to compile a list of morals as described by film critics over a few decades, correlate those morals to political party platforms with some sort of text similarity analysis, and then measure ticket sales against election results.
