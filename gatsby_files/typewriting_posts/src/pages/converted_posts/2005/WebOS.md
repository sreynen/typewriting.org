In other microformat news, over the weekend I made <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/mfzen/">a draft version of a "Microformats Zen Garden."</a> The idea, introduced on <a href="http://microformats.org/discuss/">the microformats-discuss email list</a>, is an obvious knockoff of the <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/">CSS Zen Garden</a>, only the (X)HTML is full of microformatted information, and JavaScript is added to the mix. I spent a few hours working on this, and when I was done, I realized the concept was not just an application, but almost a platform - a small hint at <a href="http://www.kottke.org/05/08/googleos-webos">the mythical web-as-operating-system</a>. Microformats act as the documents, CSS handles the visual style, and JavaScript acts as the applications. The only important thing missing is the ability to save edited documents, but <a href="http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2005-October/001112.html">Mark Pilgrim is already working on using Atom for that</a>. I'll be very interested to see how this all materializes.
