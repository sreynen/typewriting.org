<p>I'm releasing <a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/">my music</a> under a Creative Commons license, which means you don't need to ask me to copy it, and you can even republish it, provided you're not selling it and you mention where it came from so others can copy it too. Last night I watched <a href="http://www.nkhstudio.com/pages/amen_mp4.html">a short video by Nate Harrison on the "amen break"</a>. It's not really worth watching, but it's worth listening to. The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amen_break">amen break</a> is a drum loop you've probably heard. For some reason, it's an incredibly popular beat to loop behind a wide variety of music. But it's form a song that wasn't especially popular.</p><br><p>I've been meaning to add license information to my music for a while, and haven't mostly because I can't license Los Vivos' or JJ's music, and the Creative Commons embedded license system is designed to do an entire work all in one shot. So I could either add it to the page, or add it to each individual track, which would take a while. But whatever. Anyone who's interested can figure it out form the CC logo and link above my music.</p><br><p>My previous interaction with Creative Commons has been all donation-purchases. I made a donation in exchange for an autographed copy of <a href="http://www.the-future-of-ideas.com/">the Future of Ideas</a>. And then I made another donation in exchange for <a href="http://www.giantrobotprinting.com/store/shirts/commies/ccbusiness">a shirt</a> that says "your failed business model is not my problem." A long time ago I bought a shirt that says "I'm the little sister," because I like to spread gender confusion in my free time, and many people would ask me what it means. It was a good conversation piece. I expected the "your failed business model is not my problem" shirt to serve the same purpose, but no one ever asks me what it means. It's a nice shirt anyway.</p><br><p>For my book and shirt, I think I've given about $40 to Creative Commons. So yesterday I received an envelope from Creative Commons. Inside were three pieces of paper asking me for more money. The envelope was stamped with 37 cent postage. So they spent about 40 cents to send a letter to me rather than emailing me for free. This would be silly enough for a standard non-profit, but Creative Commons exists entirely on the internet, is of interest mostly to tech-savvy people, and can probably reach as many, if not more, potential donors via email than mail.</p><br><p>But don't let the pointless tree killing keep you from sharing my music on BitTorrent, or whatever you kids are using these days.</p>
