<a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4276912.stm">Here's something I don't understand.</a> <q>Catholic teaching is that homosexuality is intrinsically wrong and objectively disordered.</q> And now they're instituting a ban on gay clergy, even those who have vowed celibacy, which would seem to indicate a belief that homosexuality is a fixed condition. So some people are just born evil? Am I misunderstanding this, or is the Catholic church position really that God makes people gay and then condemns them for it?<br>Every time I read what some nut says about divine smiting, I remember what <a href="http://www.lyricsdomain.com/13/modest_mouse/bukowski.html">a modest mouse once said</a>: <q>God who'd wanna be such an asshole?</q>
