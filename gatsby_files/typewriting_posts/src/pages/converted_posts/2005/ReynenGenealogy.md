My cousin David is working on <a href="http://dave_reynen.tripod.com/genealogy.html">a genealogy of the Reynen family</a>. I'm hoping to convince him to move it off of Tripod onto my hosting, and eventually replace the static HTML with something database driven with auto-generated family trees and whatnot. He already has a lot of information and it's an interesting read for me.
