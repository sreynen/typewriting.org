here's a fun game for OS X people: create a text file with this line:<br><code>html { display: table; }</code><br>save it as fun.css, open safari's preferences, and add this file as your custom stylesheet. now go visit some webpages and watch as they melt and/or explode. you can also play this game in any application that uses safari's rendering engine and allows custom stylesheets, such as netnewswire. fun times.
