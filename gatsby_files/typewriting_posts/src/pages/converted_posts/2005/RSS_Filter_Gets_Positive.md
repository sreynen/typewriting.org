title: "RSS Filter Gets Positive"

<p>In a comment to my post about <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/rssfilter/">the RSS filter</a> I made, <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/?date=2004-01-08&amp;title=RSS+filter#comment-1164">Herr Theoretiker</a> wrote <q>I like this feature; however, would it be possible to create a filter that *includes* certain keywords instead of *excluding* them? I want to filter out the Homestar Runner feed to only include messages with "Strongbad email" in the title.</q> I'm always eager to make stuff people will use, and especially so when I know they intend to use it in the pursuit of Strongbad emails. So I added what Herr asked for to <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/rssfilter/">the RSS filter</a>. You can now do positive (must include) and/or negative (must not include) filters.</p>
