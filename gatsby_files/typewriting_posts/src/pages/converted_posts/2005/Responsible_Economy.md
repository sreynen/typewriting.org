<p><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html">What Business Can Learn from Open Source</a> is the most interesting thing I've read in a long time. Here's one of many smart insights:</p><br><blockquote>You can't expect employers to have some kind of paternal responsibility toward employees without putting employees in the position of children. And that seems a bad road to go down.</blockquote><br><p>I think this part is a just a bit too broad, though. Not all responsibilities are paternal - some are just part of living. For example, it doesn't imply the same paternal relationship to say that employers are responsible for not harming employees. This is a responsibility we assign to everyone. Other than that, I think his point about the negative consequences of giving away responsibility applies equally to other contexts. Government and religion come to mind.</p><br><p>But this is just one small section. You should really <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html">read the whole essay</a>.</p>
