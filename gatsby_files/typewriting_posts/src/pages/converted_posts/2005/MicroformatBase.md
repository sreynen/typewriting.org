The launch of <a href="http://base.google.com/">Google Base</a> inspired a bit of <a href="http://www.buzzmachine.com/index.php/2005/11/19/google-base-v-microformats/">armchair</a> <a href="http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2005-November/001955.html">quarterbacking</a> about how Google might have done it differently. One suggestion, popular - of course - among the microformats community, was that Google could use microformats to <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/2005/11/16/the-mountain/">remove the need for submission</a> to their base and leverage the distributed nature of the web.<br>Personally, I suspect there's just not enough microformatted content out there yet to make it worth Google's cycles parsing it. Lucky for me, my own parsing cycles aren't so valuable. <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/microformats/base/">Microformat Base</a> is my attempt at a microformat-based alternative to Google Base. It's slowly crawling the web looking for microformatted content, and adding it to a structured database, searchable by microformat class names. There are plenty of improvements to be made, but it's already functional in the most basic form. You can find several <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/microformats/base/?key=vcard&amp;value=Tantek">vcards for people named Tantek</a>, for example.<br>If anyone's interested, it's <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/source/?source=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.randomchaos.com%2Fmicroformats%2Fbase%2Fspider/index.php">open</a> <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/source/?source=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.randomchaos.com%2Fmicroformats%2Fbase%2Findex.php">source</a> and will eventually be open data in some form or another. I'm not looking to start a new public search engine &#8212; just demonstrate that someone with more time and experience than I and maybe an existing web crawler (**<a href="http://technorati.com/about/staff.html?s=tantek_celik#tantek_celik">cough</a> <a href="http://technorati.com/about/staff.html?s=ryan_king#ryan_king">cough</a>**) could do something like this. I suspect a decent search engine would inspire more microformatting, and may prove the best way to work around the <a href="http://typewriting.org/2005/10/24/Microformats/">chicken-egg</a> adoption problem microformats currently face. Until someone else builds it better, I'll keep tweaking <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/microformats/base/">Microformat Base</a> to that end.
