<p>I woke up this morning and was minding my own business when <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/05/21/meme-cross-fire/">Shelley</a> threw not one, but two memes at me. It's been a while since I've encountered a formal meme. My original weblog over on blogspot was called <a href="http://meme3.blogspot.com/">MEME3</a>, and to my surprise it's still there after years of neglect. I liked how the letters and numbers of "MEME3" were all pretty much the same shape turned, and at the time I thought ultimate truth or something would be found in breaking down false dichotomies. That was back in the days when I often read <a href="http://memepool.com/">memepool</a>, which is surprisingly still alive and kicking. So I have a special place in my heart for memes.</p><br><p>But this kind of thing has a bit of the feel of those "pass this around or you'll get cancer" type of chain emails, which I loathe. <a href="http://jessicamontgomerie.blogspot.com/">Jessica</a> sent me one of those with a "person least likely to return this" question, for which she had thoughtly chosen me as the answer. Sure enough, I didn't fill it out. The questions this morning are interesting enough, and I've already read them enough to know my own answers. But let's not all make a habbit of throwing memes at Scott, okay?</p><br><p>Now, first question: *Total volume of music files on my computer:* This is a tough one.  I have music scattered about three different computers right now. Some of it is my own recordings, which are of better quality, and so take up more space than a standard MP3. One computer has a <a href="http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/radioshark/">radioSHARK</a> connected, so that's full of NPR shows from the past few months. Another has a copy of NetNewWire running filled with only podcasting subscriptions. And my final machine has <a href="http://indy.tv/">Indy</a> running, which saves local copies of songs even if I only listen to five seconds. So I'm not sure what all I should be counting here. I'll just count it all now that I've made all those qualifications. I have, on those three machines respectively, 885MB, 6.97GB, and 3.25GB in my "Music" folders. By my math, that's over 11GB of audio. But I would guess only about 6 or 7GB of that is actually music.</p><br><p>*The last CD I bought:* I try not to buy CDs because I hate to indirectly fund lawsuits against music fans. I think the last CD I "bought" was actually an anti-Bush compilation from <a href="http://www.moveon.org/">MoveOn.org</a>. I think it was called "Rock Against Bush" or maybe that was a different anti-Bush compilation CD. I haven't listened to it much, but it was for a good cause (or against a bad cause), and it included a then-unreleased song by Elliott Smith, who I like a lot, though as I recall, the song wasn't that great.</p><br><p>*Song playing right now:* No audio is playing right now (Jessica is sleeping), but the last thing I listed to was "Between the Bars," by Madeleine Peyroux. It's a jazz cover of an Elliott Smith song, and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/johnnyconspirator3">JJ</a> played it for me yesterday. I still have it in my head.</p><br><p>*Five songs I listen to a lot, or that mean a lot to me:* I was going to defer to iTunes here, but it turns out my most played songs are those I've listened to repeatedly while learning them for <a href="http://losvivos.com/">Los Vivos</a>. I'm not sure those should count, but I'm also not sure how else to answer this. I'll just list five songs listen to a lot: XO by Elliott Smith, You Stay Here by Willy Porter, Cold Water by Damien Rice, <a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/mp3s/jj_hamon/song_for_a_girl_i_don't_know.mp3">Song for a Girl I Don't Know by JJ Hamon</a>, and For Liberty by me, which I just now realize is not on my website for some reason.</p><br><p>Now, meme #2, books: *You're stuck inside Fahrenheit 451, which book do you want to be?* The first few times I read this, I thought it meant "as which book do you want to be burnt?" and thought "what difference does it make?" It's been a while since I've read Fahrenheit 451. But I now realize that this is referencing the books that characters memorized so as not to lose the contents. Shelley said "when faced with a society that could condone the burning of books, truth has to matter more than beauty," and then went on to not really answer this one. But I think the book I've found most valuable in my life would be particularly appropriate for a world in which book burning was common practice: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0195632087/">The Essential Writings of Mahatma Ghandi</a>. That may not be the "ultimate book on truth" Shelley talks about, but there will be other people memorizing books, so I think this one is good enough to be worthwhile.</p><br><p>*Have you ever had a crush on a fictional character?* I guess. No one in particular, but I think I would be interested in the main characters in many stories.</p><br><p>*What are you currently reading?* In an attempt to understand the big deal about Hunter S. Thompson, I recently "borrowed" <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679785892/">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</a> from someone at my old job who I will likely never see again, but I haven't started reading it yet. I recently listened to the audio book of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/044022165X/">John Grisham's The Rainmaker</a>. Does that count? I think my last treeware book was <a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1400032717/">The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time by Mark Haddon</a>, but that was months ago.</p><br><p>*Five books you would take to a deserted island?* I would certainly not take any pleasure reading to a deserted island. I would probably start with the thickest botany book I could find, so that I could learn about the local vegetation and also have fire kindling if it came to that. Then maybe a boat-building book, a world atlas, a medical book, and a general survival guide. I wouldn't last a week on a deserted island, so my main focus would be to get back to civilization as soon as possible.</p><br><p>Now it's the fun part where I get to inflict memes upon an unsuspecting population. Bwahahaha... I'll pass to the two people I referenced here, who both conveniently have blogs: <a href="http://jessicamontgomerie.blogspot.com/">Jessica</a> and <a href="http://www.myspace.com/johnnyconspirator3">JJ</a>.</p>
