<p>So far I really like the Colbert Report, so I spent five minutes altering my <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/rss/dailyshow.xml">Daily Show RSS feed</a> and produced a <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/rss/colbertreport.xml">Colbert Report RSS feed</a>.</p><br><p>Some day Comedy Central will have useful RSS feeds. They already have a feed for the Daily Show on <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/rss/index.jhtml">their RSS page</a>, but it points to pages with completely unnecessary popup windows, which is just bad form.</p>
