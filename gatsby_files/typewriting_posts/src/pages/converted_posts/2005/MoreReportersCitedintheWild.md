title: "More Reporters Cited in the Wild" 
---
It appears the citing of a real live reporter <a href="http://typewriting.org/2005/09/06/Endangered_Species/">I mentioned earlier</a> is not an isolated incident. <a href="http://www.salon.com/ent/feature/2005/09/07/reporter_gone_wild/">Salon</a> has a video capturing several citings of actual reporters. It almost makes me want to watch the news again. But I'm not holding my breath on this lasting long. Too soon, I expect, these reporters will return to their desks where they can comfortably forget about actual issues and get back to worrying about ratings and revenue.
