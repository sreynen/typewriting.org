<p><a href="http://www.tinymixtapes.com/">tiny mix tapes</a> is a nice idea (<a href="http://www.bradsucks.net/archives/2005/02/06/tiny-mix-tapes/">pointed to by brad</a>), but i've only read a few and i'm already wanting to point out what they so wrongfully neglected to include. i mean, how can you have <a href="http://www.tinymixtapes.com/amg/2005_02_01_amgarchive.htm#110774321626769467">a mix tape with a topic of <q>I eat grapes by peeling off the skin and then I think about how the inside feels like an eyeball</q></a> and not include the pixies' debaser, with the line <q>  slicing up eyeballs</q>? oh the mix tape injustice...</p>
