<p><a href="http://www.meetup.com/changes/">MeetUp wants organizers to pay $9 a month to organize meetings.</a> What a terrible idea. And that's the special introductory rate. I could create a specific website for a MeetUp group to provide the same basic functionality MeetUp offers for less than that. In fact, if anyone is interested, I will. I'll charge $8 a month for your own group-specific MeetUp website. Comment or email me if you're interested</p>
