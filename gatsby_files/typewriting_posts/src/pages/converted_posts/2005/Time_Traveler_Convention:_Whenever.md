<p>If you're reading this from the future (or the past), there's still time to catch the <a href="http://web.mit.edu/adorai/timetraveler/">time traveler convention at MIT</a> (via <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2005/05/01/time_traveler_conven.html">BoingBoing</a>). In January, 2000 I had a post-apocalypse party. I figured it was a no-lose proposition, as there would be reason to party whether or not the much-prophesied apocalypse occurred on 01/01/2000. We would either be happy we survived, or we'd be dead, as thus unable to consider the failure of the party. (We survived.)</p><br><p>This convention is similarly no-lose, as if you miss it, you can always go back later, assuming time travel is invented, creating some reason to go back. It will be interesting to see who speaks at this convention. The field of experts must be huge, as anyone interested can always go back and make themselves experts.</p>
