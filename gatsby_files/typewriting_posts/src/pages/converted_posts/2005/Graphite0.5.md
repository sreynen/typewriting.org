<a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/software/dashboard/graphite/">Graphite 0.5 is released</a>. I added support for decimals, and removed the "beta." I'm going to submit it as widely as I can now. I've been putting this off in an attempt to catch bugs before most people ever use it, but I'm not getting much feedback anymore, so I need some more users. First stop: Apple's site.
