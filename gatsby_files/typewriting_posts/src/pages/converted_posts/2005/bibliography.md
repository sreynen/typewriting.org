<p>one of my recent projects was a <a href="http://www.pabn.org/bibliography/">collective bibliography tool</a>. it's pretty much <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a> with books and films added to the tagged mix. unfortunately, of about 120 users for whom i made accounts and announced this tool, i appear to be the only person using it. i'm not sure why i bother, but i continue to post everything i see recommended on <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/bncpj/">this group's email list</a>, hoping some day someone else will notice this nifty tool and start using it.</p><br><p>but that's not why i'm pointing you to it. you can't actually post items using this tool unless you are one of the select few who has an account, and odds are you're not. but you can see what a bunch of peaceniks are recommending to each other and appreciate what a great application i made.</p>
