<p><a href="http://www.lifeofarory.com/">Rory</a> is using my MySpace blog scraping code to keep a copy of his blog on his own server. I hadn't even considered that as a potential use. Good idea, Rory. It just took a few minutes to make the changes. That makes two features MySpace could be offering (and charging for): RSS feeds and off-site hosting. It's a shame they're not providing such functionality, but at least they haven't (yet) tried to prevent others from providing it.</p>
