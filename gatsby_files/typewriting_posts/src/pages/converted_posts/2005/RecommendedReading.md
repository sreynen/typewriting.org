<p>I think it was just last week that I subscribed to Dave Roger's blog after he said some seemingly intelligent things over on Shelley Power's blog. Two days ago I saw that he had a new post and I went to read it, but after reading a few paragraphs, I saw that it was quite long and put it away. My mistake. Lucky for me, Shelley read the whole thing and <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/09/07/good-morning-dave/">wrote</a> that <q>It is by far the best work he has ever done, and one of the best writings I've read this year.</q> So I went back and read the whole thing tonight, and I can now confirm that it is indeed well worth the read. Maybe it's just because it's so timely, but right now it seems not just one of, but *the* best writing I've read this year. <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dave_rogers/GHD09-05.html#note_2373">It's called <cite>Change</cite>. Go read it.</a> If you find your attention start to waver at the beginning as mine did, skip straight to <q>When I was executive officer of USS JOHN HANCOCK (DD-981), I had to perform my first burial at sea.</q></p>
