title: "MySpace Feeds Updated"

<p>I've updated the MySpace <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/myspace/">blog</a> and <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/myspace/comments/">comments</a> RSS feed scripts. You can now enter pretty much any site that even references the MySpace account desired and the scripts will figure out where the appropriate blog or comments are.</p><br><p>I tested parsing on several different blogs, but of course, there may be others that I haven't tested and don't work. If you try something and it doesn't work, let me know what account it is so I can try to fix it.</p>
