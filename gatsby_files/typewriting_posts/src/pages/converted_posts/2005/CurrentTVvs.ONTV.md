<p>One of the best things my parents did for me as a child was not getting cable television. Since then, cable television has become more and more pervasive, so much so that the broadcast television is <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7593620/">scheduled to die next year</a>. But I have never paid for cable television. I would have been more likely to pay for cable TV if it was less pervasive, but why pay for it when everyone else I know has it? Not only can I watch it on other people's TVs, but I also have a natural filter of all the worthless television, because I never hear about it from other people. No one walks around saying "Did you see that show last night? It wasn't worth watching," though plenty of people watch such shows.</p><br><p>I think many in the FCC and the rest of the TV industry are assuming broadcast TV will be replaced, to whatever extent it hasn't been already, by cable and satellite TV. But <a href="http://www.rushkoff.com/2005/08/current-tv.php">Douglas Rushkoff</a> says <q>The "next big thing" in media will not happen on TV - or at least not primarily on TV. It will happen on or through the Internet.</q> And I think it's reasonable to expect it will happen around the same time broadcast TV formally dies. And so cable TV will die soon after.</p><br><p>One can get a vague sense of this with the explosion of weblogs, and more recently podcasting. Participatory publishing is moving into higher-bandwidth media, and television is the next logical step. But why go with a vague sense when <a href="http://openvision.tv/">Open Network TV</a> makes the future much clearer.</p><br><p><a href="http://openvision.tv/home/ion.html">ONTV's beta release of a video aggregator</a> is pretty bad. It has user interface confusion all over the place, and there's just not enough content yet. But still, it's better than the cable TV alternative, <a href="http://current.tv/">Current TV</a>, for the simple reason that I can watch whatever I want with I/ON. That this is the future of television changes from a hunch to completely obvious after using this tool for five minutes. Imagining how much better I/ON would (and will) be with the resources that have been poured into Current TV, I think <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20050516&amp;s=berman">Al Gore made a big mistake</a>.</p><br><p>Current TV's about page starts by saying <q>Right now, at this moment in history, TV is the most powerful medium in the world.</q> I think that moment passed already.</p>
