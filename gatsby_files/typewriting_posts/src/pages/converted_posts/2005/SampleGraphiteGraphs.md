<p>I made <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/software/dashboard/graphite/graphs/">a page to show sample Graphite graphs</a>. The two there now show that Firefox downloads continue at a steady pace, which doesn't surprise me, and Google's index of the web changes often and sometimes drastically, which does surprise me. It takes at least a few days for the graphs to get interesting, so I don't have a lot now, but I'll keep adding more, and if anyone else has any graphs to share, please send them my way.</p>
