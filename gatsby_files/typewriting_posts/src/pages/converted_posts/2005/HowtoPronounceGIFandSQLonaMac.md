title: "How to Pronounce GIF and SQL on a Mac" 
---
With all the new features in OSX 10.4 Tiger, and now the controversy over <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/07/AR2005060700367.html">Apple's move to Intel chips</a>, few have noticed that Apple has quietly taken sides in some old technology debates: how to pronounce GIF and SQL. In brief, the debates are whether one should say "jif" (the peanut butter of choosy moms) or "gif" (like gift without the "t"), and "sequel" (like the second version of a movie) or "es cue el."  The latter debate is a little more important (or a little less ridiculous) as it affects not only how you pronounce the acronym, but which article ("a" or "an") you use before, so it comes into play even if you never say "SQL" aloud.  Out on the battlefield, <a href="http://www.olsenhome.com/gif/">Steve Olsen has obviously spent a lot of time expounding the virtues of "jif" pronunciation</a>, while the SQL debate is largely muted by <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/what-is.html">MySQL's declaration</a>:<br><blockquote>The official way to pronounce "MySQL'' is "My Ess Que Ell'' (not "my sequel''), but we don't mind if you pronounce it as "my sequel'' or in some other localized way.</blockquote><br>During my interview for my new job, I became conscious of my own internal pronunciation when I referred to "my sequel" and everyone else had been talking about "my es cue el."  But I managed to get the job anyway. And with the release of Tiger, Apple confirms that I was right. In the new VoiceOver screen reading utility's "Pronunciation" section, Apple has added pronunciations for "GIF" ("jiff") and "SQL" ("sequel") as well as "GUI" ("G U I" - not "gooey") and a bunch more. You can change these pronunciations, but you can no longer run "an es cue el server" or create "jiffs" on a factory Mac.
