<p>I promised myself I would never write about Lisp again after <a href="http://typewriting.org/2005/11/12/How_not_to_Provoke_Imitation/">accidentally stumbling</a> into a mob in search of a flame war. But <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/rewritingreddit">Aaron Swartz's account of an irrational Lisp community</a> sounded too familiar to ignore:</p><br><blockquote><p>The idea that there is something better than Lisp is apparently inconceivable to some, judging from comments <a href="http://reddit.com/blog/2005/12/night-of-living-python.html">on the reddit blog</a>. The Lispers instead quickly set about trying to find the *real* reason behind the switch.</p><br><p>One assumed it must have been divine intervention, since "there seems to be no other reason for switching to an inferior language." Another figured something else must be going on: "Could this be...a lie? To throw off competition? It's not as though Paul Graham hasn't hinted at this tactic in his essays..." Another chimed in: "I decided it was a prank." Another suggested the authors simply wanted more "cut corners, hacks, and faked artisanship."</p></blockquote><br><p>So it's not just me. Turns out Reddit's post followed the same path as my own. It was posted on <a href="http://lemonodor.com/archives/001301.html">Lemonodor</a>, without context, and with emphasis that spun it as a vehemently anti-Lisp post, and then it was picked up by <a href="http://planet.lisp.org/">Planet Lisp</a>. I take back <a href="http://typewriting.org/2005/11/15/Other_Planetary_Damange/">what I said</a> about the problems with planet sites. It's not the aggregator, it's the writer that removes the context. John Wiseman is the author of Lemonodor. I want to paraphrase <a href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0410/15/cf.01.html">Jon Stewart</a> and say to John Wiseman: Stop, stop, stop, stop hurting Lisp.</p><br><p>By provoking unnecessarily emotional defenses of Lisp across the web, John is causing otherwise neutral people like myself to actively avoid the Lisp community, because it comes off as a bunch of irrational trolls. I know there are intelligent people using Lisp, but John's reposts distort people's actual views through half-truths and re-emphasis, and the result makes Lisp look like a language only ridiculous people use, people who say things <a href="http://typewriting.org/2005/11/12/How_not_to_Provoke_Imitation/#comment-1588">like</a> <q>When you say that you've never spoken Chinese and have no interest in learning it, you are not being anti-Chinese, but you are being closeminded and parochial</q> <a href="http://reddit.com/blog/2005/12/night-of-living-python.html#113380843112882577">or</a> <q>My first reaction was 'say it ain't so'. Then I decided it was a prank.<br></q></p><br><p>This type of comment prompts reactions <a href="http://reddit.com/blog/2005/12/on-lisp.html#113389379135846949">like</a> <q>I have never been on a lisp forum but the way the lispers here are reacting are sure to keep me off it too...</q> True that.</p>
