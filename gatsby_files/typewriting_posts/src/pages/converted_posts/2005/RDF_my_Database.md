<p>Last night <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/2005/10/28/the-bottoms-up-rdf-tutorial/">Shelley Powers published a lengthy RDF tutorial</a>, in which she wrote <q>I'm focusing on what I call *street RDF*&#8211;RDF that can be used out of the box to meet a need ...</q> I've read about RDF before, and I read about it again, but the needs RDF meets are still not clear to me. Today <a href="http://dannyayers.com/archives/2005/10/29/metadata/">Danny Ayers</a> wrote <q>But the statements can be made available by techniques like mapping SQL database tables to RDF ...</q> Fair enough. I've started <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/database/">making my database available via XHTML</a>, and will add more tables soon. Now if anyone wants to convince me of the value of RDF, I invite you to explain to me how to represent my database as RDF, and show me how this helps me or anyone else.</p>
