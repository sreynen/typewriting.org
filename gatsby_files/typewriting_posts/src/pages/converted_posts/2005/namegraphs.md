<a href="http://babynamewizard.com/namevoyager/lnv0105.html">the baby name wizard</a> is a neat visualization of baby name trends (which i spotted days ago on <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/39392">metafilter</a>). i noticed a few trends: names that are popular today were unpopular in the 1960s, there are fewer names popular today, and the 60s names tend to start with vowels, Q, X and Z.  i can't think of explanations for any of this, but the visuals make it appear to be more than mere coincidence.  for example, compare "peter" and "patrick" with "oliver" and "owen" or "beth" and "becky" with "anna" and "abby." or just flip through the alphabet and watch which letters peak on the end(s) or the middle. hmm.
