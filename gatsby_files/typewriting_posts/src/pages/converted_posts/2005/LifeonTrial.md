A friend of mine sent me a link to a <a href="http://www.courttv.com/news/2005/1110/harriton_ctv.html?link=eaf">'wrongful life' court case</a> filed by a disabled Australian woman. That alone is interesting enough, but here's my favorite part:<br><blockquote>Studdert also cited rulings from foreign courts, including the United States, which addressed the esoteric difficulties of putting a dollar tag on "the value of non existence" as compared to the costs of living with a disability.</blockquote><br>How much is non-existence worth? What a great question. Earlier <a href="http://typewriting.org/2005/10/26/Existentialist_Means/">I tried to explain my existentialist leanings</a>. In the future I'll just point to this case. The woman apparently wants to live or she would have killed herself. Yet she's basically putting life itself on trial to demand that someone else take responsibility for her life's unpleasantness. It's an excellent formalism of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_faith">bad faith</a>. We all blame others for choices we won't bring ourselves to make. But few of us do it so honestly.<br>One of the random quotes on <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/">the front page</a> is from Simone de Beauvoir:<br><blockquote>There is no such thing as a natural death: nothing that happens to a man is ever natural, since his presence calls the world into question. All men must die: but for every man his death is an accident and, even if he knows it and consents to it, an unjustifiable violation.</blockquote><br>For this woman, however, life is an accident and, even though she knows it and consents to it, an unjustifiable violation. It will be interesting to see if the Australian High Court agrees.
