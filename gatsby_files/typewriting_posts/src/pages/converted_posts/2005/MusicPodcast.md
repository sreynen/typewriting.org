<a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/">&#174;&#x00A4;&#169;: music</a> now has <a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/feed/">a podcast feed</a> that will include new music as I put it on the server. I now have a recording setup using an iSight camera and a Mac Mini, which works surprisingly well because the Mac Mini is so quiet and the iSight's mic is much better than one might expect. So if you subscribe now, you'll get my new not-terrible-quality recordings when I start making them over the next few weeks.
