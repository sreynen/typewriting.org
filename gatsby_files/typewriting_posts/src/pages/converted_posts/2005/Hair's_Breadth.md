<p>Hair's Breadth ( <a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/mp3s/scott_reynen/hairs_breadth.mp3">MP3</a>, <a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/lyrics/scott_reynen/hairs_breadth">lyrics</a>) is my first recording on my new used guitar.</p><br><img src="http://typewriting.org/image/article/content/framus_guitar.png" /><br><p>It's a twelve string (with only six strings currently) Framus, which is a brand I'd never heard of before seeing this guitar. In the picture, you'll note some holes in the front of the body. That's where the pickup knobs are going to go once I have my soon-to-be professional <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luthier">luthier</a> friend <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jjhamon">JJ</a> put them in and do some other repairs to it.</p><br><p>I never had a pickup put into my six string Ibanez guitar because I dropped it in Taiwan, ironically while exiting the airport after a long trip spent worrying about my guitar getting damaged on the plane. So now it has an unrepairable dent in the back, and even though it plays fine it seems a waste of money to give it a pickup.</p><br><p>After I get a pickup in the new Framus, I'll just need a mic and I'll be ready to play out somewhere. And then I just need to find somewhere out to play. I recently discovered the Ritual Caf&#233; in Des Moines, which is unfortunately lacking a website of any sort. It has vegetarian food, wifi, and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22ritual+caf%C3%A9%22">according to Google</a>, is host a lot of musicians I like. So that's my long-term music goal: get the guitar fixed up, get a mic, and get a gig at the Ritual Caf&#233;.</p><br><p>Meanwhile, I have a bunch of songs to record. I just figured out how to use Tracktion to do real-time editing or whatever you call it where you twiddle the knobs and sliders while playing through the recording to have different volume or other settings in different parts of the song. So that should improve the quality of recordings a bit. Now I just need to learn how to keep time with a click track. I think I'll <a href="http://ask.metafilter.com/mefi/28196">Ask MetaFilter</a> about that.</p>
