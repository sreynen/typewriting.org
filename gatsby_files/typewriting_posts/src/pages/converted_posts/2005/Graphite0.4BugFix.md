<q><a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/software/dashboard/graphite/">0.4 beta fixed a bug in 0.3 beta that made nothing work (oops!).</a></q><br>I'm excited about <a href="http://www.dashboardwidgets.com/showcase/details.php?wid=1249">the comments I've been getting over on the Dashboard Widget showcase</a>. Even though that version is completely broken, the few people who went to the trouble to fix it themselves seem to really like Graphite.
