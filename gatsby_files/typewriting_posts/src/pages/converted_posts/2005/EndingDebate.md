title: "Ending Debate"

Jessica and (more so) her brother David have been writing a weblog called <cite><a href="http://parasox.blogspot.com">Rhetoric and Culture of Publics</a></cite>. I'm not entirely sure what that means, but it's generally about political issues, and has a somewhat more interesting perspective than the standard "yeah us, boo them" slant.<br>For example, <a href="http://parasox.blogspot.com/2005/12/evolution-and-intelligent-design-some.html">David recently wrote about the apparent end of the "intelligent design" "debate"</a> with <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4545822.stm">the US district court's recent rejection</a>. He says <q>I fear the fight is not yet over. Creationists are entrenched, they have a plan, and it will not be denied after this singular ruling.</q> But I disagree. I think the fight was over a long time ago.<br>David mentions Pastafarians saying <q>One strategy is to follow in line with Bobby Henderson and his <a href="http://www.venganza.org/index.htm">Flying Spaghetti Monster</a> and escalate the confrontation.</q> But I think he misread the FSM. It didn't escalate the confrontation at all; it ended it.<br>In <cite><a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/say.html">What You Can't Say</a></cite>, Paul Graham wrote:<br><blockquote>No one gets in trouble for saying that 2 + 2 is 5, or that people in Pittsburgh are ten feet tall. Such obviously false statements might be treated as jokes, or at worst as evidence of insanity, but they are not likely to make anyone mad.</blockquote><br>What the FSM does is make it clear that intelligent design is as ridiculous as 2+2=5, so we need not bother discussing it. Now that we recognize this, it's game over. If creationists want to continue their crusade, they will inevitably be touched by His Noodly Appendage and see the foolishness of it all. There is simply no way to win an argument with a devout Pastafarian in full pirate regalia.
