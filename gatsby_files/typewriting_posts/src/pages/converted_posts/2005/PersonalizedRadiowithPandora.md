<a href="http://www.pandora.com/">Pandora</a> is a neat tool. It creates a personal radio station for you based on the musical style of an artist of your choosing. You can then customize it further with feedback on individual songs it has chosen. I'd like it to do more to expand my musical interests rather than just continually focusing or shifting them. And I'd also like to see it incorporate non-label music. But as is, it's a great example of where radio is headed.
