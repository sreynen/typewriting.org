shelley kindly notified me that the comment forms were gone. a little investigation revealed that they weren't actually gone; they were just not showing up. too much time spent in further investigation led me to the conclusion that display:table was <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2005-03-06&amp;title=wacky+safari+bug">yet again</a> to blame, and should not be used by mere CSS mortals like myself. however, i don't know how else to make <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/photo/?id=189">pages with giant images</a> look good, so i'm continuing to use it on a more limited basis. i'm sure i'll discover shortly that this is still breaking things, and give up on display:table altogether.
