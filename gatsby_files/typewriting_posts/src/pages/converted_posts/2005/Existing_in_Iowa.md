<p>I was a little worried not everyone understood <a href="http://typewriting.org/2005/12/13/That_was_Completely_Different/">the analogy I was trying to make between gay marriage and interracial marriage</a>. Thankfully Douglas Sadler has done a good job of <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20051228/NEWS10/51228003/1001/">clearing up any confusion</a> I might have left.</p><br><blockquote><p>"We don't believe they have the right to marry," Sadler said. "In fact, we don't think they have the right to exist."</p></blockquote><br><p>Nothing clarifies a controversial political issue like unabashed hatred.</p>
