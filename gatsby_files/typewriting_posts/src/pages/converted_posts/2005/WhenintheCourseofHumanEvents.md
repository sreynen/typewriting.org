<p>In case you missed it, the <strike>President</strike> King broke <a href="http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode50/usc_sec_50_00001802----000-.html">the law</a> by spying on Americans without legal oversight. Though some in Congress knew about it, they apparently forgot their <a href="http://www.pegmusic.com/congressional-oath.html">oath</a> to <q>support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign <strong>and domestic</strong></q> when they decided not to tell America about it.</p><br><p>In <a href="http://www.law.indiana.edu/uslawdocs/declaration.html">other words</a>, <q>he has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.</q> Or maybe it would be better to say <q>he has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the consent of our legislatures.</q> Or maybe the executive branch is just <q>suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.</q></p><br><p>This, after <q>protecting <a href="http://www.antiwar.com/news/?articleid=2444">them</a>, by a <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2005/LAW/05/04/prisoner.abuse.england/">mock Trial</a>, from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States</q> and <q>depriving us, <a href="http://www.epic.org/privacy/terrorism/hr3162.html">in many cases</a>, of the benefits of Trial by Jury</q> and <q><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4524864.stm">transporting</a> us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences.</q> Also, <q>he is at this time transporting large <a href="http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0303/p06s02-woam.html">Armies of foreign Mercenaries</a> to compleat the works of death, desolation and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty and perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.</q></p><br><p>Basically, it looks like <q>he has abdicated Government here, by declaring us <a href="http://www.voanews.com/english/2005-12-19-voa60.cfm">out of his Protection</a> and waging War against us.</q> Or maybe I'm thinking of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom">a totally different George</a> with <q>plain, homely, thrifty manners and tastes.</q></p>
