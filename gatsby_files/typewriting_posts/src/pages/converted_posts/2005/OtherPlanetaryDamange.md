Earlier this month, Phil Rignalda wrote a post titled "<a href="http://weblog.philringnalda.com/?p=1008">Planetary Damage</a>," the damage being that individuals like <a href="http://dannyayers.com/archives/2005/11/03/new-toys-2/">Danny Ayers</a> don't feel the need to write about things that show up on sites like <a href="http://planetrdf.com/">Planet RDF</a>. I, like Phil, read Danny and <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/">Shelley Powers</a> but not Planet RDF, so if Danny or Shelley don't write about something in the world of RDF, I don't read it. Planet sites run the risk of forming closed communities in which the only people reading about a technology are those already using it.  And that's one form of planetary damage<br>I experienced another sort today when <a href="http://typewriting.org/2005/11/12/How_not_to_Provoke_Imitation/">something I wrote (which I thought was about screencasts)</a> made its way onto <a href="http://planet.lisp.org/">Planet Lisp</a>. My comments on Lisp weren't altogether positive, and that brought the fanboys out to tell me how evil I am for hating Lisp. The thing is, I *don't* hate Lisp. I don't even care about Lisp. I know next to nothing about Lisp. I certainly don't belong on Planet Lisp. <a href="http://www.planet-php.net/">Planet PHP</a>, maybe. <a href="http://planet.openjsan.org/">Planet JavaScript</a> would be a stretch. But Planet Lisp? That's just ridiculous. In this case, I wish the community were a bit *more* closed, with the only people *writing* about a technology being those who are already using it.
