<p>Last night I learned how to play <cite><a href="http://chordie.com/chord.pere/www.guitartabs.cc/fetchfile.php?fileid=7185258">Say Hello, Wave Goodbye</a></cite>, a song I've only heard by David Gray, but which was apparently written by Marc Almond of Soft Cell.  After that, I noticed <a href="http://chordie.com/chord.pere/getsome.org/guitar/olga/chordpro/d/Bob.Dylan/IfYouSeeHerSayHello.chopro">a Bob Dylan song</a> by a similar name that I'm not sure I've ever heard. So I played along with the chords doing my best Dylan imitation. Then I started writing a new song. Last night it seemed very Dylan-esque, and I was quite pleased with myself. I seem to have lost a bit of the Dylan this morning, but I think it's still a pretty good song.</p><br><p>This time I managed to play along at a steady tempo for a scratch track, so I recorded it in three separate tracks. I think the timing of the three may be slightly off due to a software buffer in my recording setup, and I think there are a few hiccups as I had other software running at the same time. But I think it's pretty good nonetheless. I even figured out how to make my guitar sound like both a banjo and a bass, so I can now imitate a three piece bluegrass band.</p><br><p>I'm sure I could spend all day improving it, but I say it's good enough for now. The song is called Melted All Away (<a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/mp3s/scott_reynen/melted_all_away.mp3">MP3</a>, <a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/lyrics/scott_reynen/melted_all_away">lyrics</a>), and I think it's sort of written from the perspective of one of the main characters in <a href="http://www.litkicks.com/Books/DharmaBums.html">Dharma Bums</a>, whose philosophical perspectives act as a convenient buffer against reality.</p>
