<p>I have taken to making chocolate covered foods in the past few months. I started with a recipe a coworker gave me for thin mint cookies. I most recently made chocolate-covered strawberries, which are the easiest thing I've made, but the most impressive to others. People at work went on and on saying "Wow Scott, you made these strawberries?! Great job!" as if I had actually grown the strawberries.</p><br><p>They liked the thin mints too, but were less enthusiastic, which is ironic since they are more difficult to make. Most of the work is in the dipping, and strawberries are easy because they come with a dipping mechanism (the leaves) attached, so they don't need to be completely covered. It isn't easy to completely cover something in chocolate while holding it. The trick is to put a bit too much chocolate on. That way when you remove whatever you were holding it with - I've been using a platic fork with the middle two prongs snapped off - the excess chocolate will fill the void it leaves.</p><br><img src="http://typewriting.org/image/article/content/melted_chocolate.jpg" alt="melted chocolate"/><br><p>Another difficulty in making chocolate covered foods is melting the chocolate. If you want to melt chocolate, you should do it in a double-boiler to prevent it from heating too quickly.  If chocolate is too cold, it won't run smoothly until it's heated, but if it gets too hot, it coagulates and it won't run smoothly ever again. I know this because I've done it wrong a few times. Yesterday I was trying to explain something to a friend of mine with whom I often have heated discussions, and it occurred to me that discussions heat like chocolate. If they get too hot, they'll won't run smoothly ever again. I know this because I've done it wrong a few times.</p>
