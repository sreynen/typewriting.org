The discussion in <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/03/25/the-importance-of-degrading-gracefully/">Shelley's post about degrading gracefully</a> prompted me to write my second Firefox Greasemonkey script. <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/software/firefox/greasemonkey/degradr/">Degradr </a> replaces the pointless flash-embedded images on <a href="http://flickr.com/">flickr.com</a> with plain images. I'm always wanting to copy images I see on flickr to use as desktop backgrounds, but the flash interface makes this too much trouble. (Maybe that's the purpose?) With Degradr, the images are just like any other image, so I can copy, zoom, and do everything else Firefox let's me do with images.
