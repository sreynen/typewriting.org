<p>I've decided to learn better design practices the old fashioned way: by stealing them. I'm playing around with a fixed-width design, which seems to be somewhat standard practice among pretty sites. In doing so, I ran into the problem of the page titles being too long for the width. So I replaced "randomchaos" with a pseudo-logo - &#174;&#x00A4;&#169; - created with <a href="http://www.mezzoblue.com/archives/2005/07/25/glyphs/index.php">glyphs</a>. Not sure I like it yet, but I'm going to give it a while to grow on me.</p>
