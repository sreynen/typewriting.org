I've been living in Des Moines and working at Integer for a few weeks now. I haven't written about my initial impressions, nor much of anything else here, mostly because I still don't have internet access at home. <a href="http://www.qwest.com/">Qwest</a> neglected to send me the first DSL modem I ordered, and has still not sent me the second. Monday will mark the second 'five business days' <abbr title="Estimated Time of Arrival">ETA</abbr>, but I'm not holding my breath. I already strongly suspect they don't take their "Spririt of Service" motto very seriously. So my only internet access is at work, where I spend most of my time, well, working. I could probably find time to write weblog posts at work, as my schedule has been fairly flexible so far, but I haven't written much yet. I did write my previous post at work, as I came across the information while looking for OSX screen readers to test accessibility for websites.<br>That's a pretty good summary of the job so far: I get to make websites, worry about things like accessibility, and feel free to wander off now and then on  tangents like the proper pronunciation of SQL and GIF. It's a fun job, and I look forward to Mondays, especially during this first month as I have little to do and little money with which to do it outside of work.<br>My first project was a database and interface for tracking postage costs at Integer and billing them to the employee or client as appropriate. I would point to it but it's an intranet site, plus it hasn't yet been implemented. I got to play with a neat auto-complete text field for that, which I'll probably clean up a bit and post here for others to use at some point, as I haven't seen the same functionality elsewhere.<br>I'm now working on the administrative side (not the side you can actually see) of the <a href="http://pressroom.pella.com/">Pella Pressroom</a> site, as well as a section of the <a href="http://www.iciu.org/">Iowa Council for International Understanding</a> site, which will be the first thing I do at work that anyone outside Integer can see.<br>The apartment is good too, as is the city, what little I've so far experienced. Right now I'm sitting at <a href="http://www.javajoescoffeehouse.com/">Java Joe's Coffeehouse</a>, where I've been sitting for a few hours using their free WiFi and eating their only-moderately-overpriced food. Earlier today I was sitting on one of the benches near the <a href="http://www.oldenburgvanbruggen.com/crusoeumbrella.htm">Crusoe Umbrella</a> and sucking up the surprisingly free, though somewhat flaky WiFi from a <a href="http://marriott.com/property/propertypage/DSMBR">nearby hotel</a>.<br>Once I get an internet connection at home I'll post more here on the weblog and fix up the site. Once I get an audio input box and find more space to store online recordings, I'll start posting more music. Once I get a new camera, I'll post more photos. In general, once I get out of the debt I went into through not working for a couple weeks and then moving, I will start to figure out how life is going to work here. But it's pretty good already.
