<p>In other interesting <a href="http://typewriting.org/2005/11/20/Autism%2C_Synaesthesia%2C_and_Neuroendocrinology/">neuroendocrinology</a> news, <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/hsn/20051130/hl_hsn/alzheimerscouldbediabeteslikeillnessstudysuggests">Alzheimer's may be something like diabetes of the brain</a>. It would be nice to combine research on the two, but so far it's just a largely unsubstantiated theory.</p>
