I just posted <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/software/dashboard/graphite/">Graphite 0.3</a>. It makes the process of creating a graph about as simple as possible:<br><ul><br><li>Open a site in Safari</li><br><li>Open a Graphite widget's info by clicking the 'i'</li><br><li>Click 'Discover URL' to get the URL of the frontmost site in Safari</li><br><li>Click 'Discover Text' to get a list of numbers on that site</li><br><li>Click the number you want to graph to get the approriate search text for that number</li><br><li>Click 'Done'</li><br></ul><br>This is simple enough that I'm ready to start submitting Graphite to various widget sites. I think I'll hold off on Apple's widget list until I get some feedback and polish it up a bit.
