Last week I bought a <a href="http://www.specialized.com/bc/SBCBkModel.jsp?minisite=10080&amp;spid=9354&amp;bikeTab=features">Specialized Sirrus</a> bike. I've ridden it to work twice this week, and expect it to be my standard transport to work. With gas alone at current prices, I will need to save about 250 gallons before I pay it off savings. My tank holds about 15 gallons, so that makes about 17.5 fill-ups. At my standard of a a fill-up roughly every two weeks, that makes it about year before I'll break even. That's assuming I ride about 35 weeks a year, but that's also assuming gas doesn't go up. I expect those two assumptions to prove equally false.<br>In addition to saving money, I get exercise on my way to work. <a href="http://www.sueandpaul.com/gmapPedometer/?centerX=-93.63724708557129&amp;centerY=41.577250669683295&amp;zl=3&amp;fl=m-e-h-0-1&amp;polyline=ctz%7CFzepzPhTbA%3F%7BSbe@sGdH%7CZnSzK%60a@nFz%60ANVsH%60E%3F%7E@%7CE_A%7DEaE%3FWrH%7B%60AOaa@oFoS%7BKeH%7DZce@rG%3FzSiTcA">Gmaps Pedometer says I ride about five miles a day</a>. It doesn't that seem that far, but that may be because the scenery is still new. I expect I'll eventually buy an iPod to entertain myself on the ride.<br>The bike was the third most expensive purchase I've ever made, after computers and cars (in that order). But I expect over the next year it will turn out to be a better deal than both.
