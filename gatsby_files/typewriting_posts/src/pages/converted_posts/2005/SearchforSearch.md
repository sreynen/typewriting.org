Google has begun returning results for things you didn't type, but maybe should have. For example, if you search for "opera," you get a block of results for "oprah." It looks like it will benefit people who don't know what they're looking for, and probably annoy people who do. I don't like it yet.<br>I was testing this out with random words when I typed in 'search' and saw that Google returned itself as the top result. And then I thought it would be interesting to try a search for 'search' on various search engines. It turns out Google is the *only* search engine that returns itself as the top result for 'search.'<br><table><br><tr><br><th>Search Engine</th><th>Top Result</th><br></tr><br><tr><br><td>Google</td><td>Google</td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td>Altavista</td><td>Search.com</td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td>Yahoo</td><td>Search.com</td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td>Search.com</td><td>MSN Search</td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td>MSN Search</td><td>Google</td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td>AOL Search</td><td>Google</td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td>Lycos</td><td>Search.com</td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td>Ask Jeeves</td><td>Lycos</td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td>Dogpile</td><td>Altavista</td><br></tr><br><tr><br><td>Excite</td><td>Google</td><br></tr><br></table><br>Google is also the most popular search engine among search engines, just slightly ahead of Search.com.
