I just posted <cite>Not Gonna Rain</cite> (<a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/mp3s/scott_reynen/not_gonna_rain.mp3">MP3</a> , <a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/lyrics/scott_reynen/not_gonna_rain">lyrics</a>), a song I started singing in the car last week on my way to work after reading <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/category/weather/">something about weather on Shelley's weblog</a> and thinking about how complaining about rain is cliche, but complaining about dryness isn't. Of course, since then, it has <a href="http://ezrakilty.net/ezlog/archives/000715.html">rained</a> a plenty. As Shelley said in <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/08/30/human-nature/">her most recent weather post</a>, <q>weather is so wonderfully ironic.</q> <br>I think this is slightly better recording quality than much of my recordings on the music server currently, but it's just a rough cut, done all in one take. It's the kind of thing I'd like to make the time to use as a scratch track to listen to while recording each instrument separately and then mixing them, raising the vocals a bit here and the guitar a bit there. Maybe adding some percussion and a soft accordion in the background. But for now, this is the recording I've done. I'm going to call this a <a href="http://www.free-soft.org/literature/papers/esr/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar-4.html">release early, release often</a> model for music, and hope that means I'll eventually get back to a better version of this and other songs.
