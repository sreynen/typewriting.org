<p><a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/archive/2005/02/11/morphing_faces.html">howard rheingold</a> writes <q>The results demonstrated that respondents were significantly more likely to vote for the candidate with whom their face had been morphed</q> and then <q>it might be possible for political candidates to juice up their persuasiveness in my household by morphing my driver's license photo into the image of their face</q>. i suspect it will start with more general demographics, and very subtle morphing. commercials played in primarily hispanic voting precincts will make the candidate(s) appear slightly more hispanic. this practice will then continue to become more targeted and more blatant until someone catches it. i'm interested in a few questions: what year will this begin: 2008? 2012? or has it *already* begun? how long before the opposite is done (i.e. morphing an opponent's face ever so slightly with, say, hitler)? and how will voters react to this? surely if we were going to become upset enough about being manipulated by politicians to actually change our votes, we would have done so already, right?</p>
