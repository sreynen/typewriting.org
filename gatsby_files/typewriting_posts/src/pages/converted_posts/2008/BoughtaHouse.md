title: "Bought a House"

We bought a house today, off Craigslist, without a realtor. Yeah, I know, that sounds really stupid. And maybe it was, but it still feels like a good deal. In <a href="http://typewriting.org/2008/02/03/No_Time_to_Write/#content">a previous post</a>, you'll recall I said <q>We'll know soon if we're buying that or continuing to look.</q> We found out soon after that the house was being sold to someone else. And I was all ready to give up on buying a house and start looking at rental options when Jackie (my sister-in-law) found this house on Craigslist.<br>That was about a month ago; today we bought it. We won't move for another month or so, but then my new address will be 460 S. Grant, Denver CO 80209. <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;client=safari&amp;q=460+S+Grant+St,+Denver,+CO+80209,+USA&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=39.711561,-104.984&amp;spn=0.010812,0.018024&amp;z=16&amp;layer=c&amp;cbll=39.708262,-104.984028&amp;cbp=1,91.76151702879633,,0,4.832350948142998">Here it is on Google Maps (street view)</a>. One thing that came up in the inspection: despite what Google Maps shows, it's not consistently sunny on the property. But it is sunny sometimes. Today was sunny.
