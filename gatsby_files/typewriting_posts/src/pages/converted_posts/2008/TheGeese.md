<p>I saw the geese again on my way to work today, ambling across the otherwise busy street. And I laughed out loud just like I do each time I see them. I don't think it's the geese themselves that delight me. It's not even their effect on traffic, forcing us all to slow to their pace, knowing the horns and gestures we'd typically send to a person moving so slow would be useless here. I think it's the absurdity of the situation that makes me laugh. It wouldn't amuse me so in the country. But here we are in the middle of a city, surrounded by modernity, buildings full of people who create nothing but ideas, and the best we can do here is stop our cars and wait for these geese to walk.</p>
