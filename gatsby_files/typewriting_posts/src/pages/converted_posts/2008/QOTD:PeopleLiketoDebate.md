title: "QOTD: People Like to Debate" 
---
<blockquote><p>People like to debate the phenomenon of global climate change as if it were an academic issue. People who don't live in the path of the huang-sa dust storms that sweep in out of China to blanket Korea every spring, and get worse with each passing year, people who aren't in Central British Columbia watching 85% of the pine trees die off, and with the trees, the futures of their children. People whose health or livelihood isn't directly affected.</p></blockquote><br><p>&#8212; <a href="http://emptybottle.org/glass/2008/07/my_home_is_dying.php"><cite>Stavros the Wonder Chicken</cite>, My Home Is Dying</a></p>
