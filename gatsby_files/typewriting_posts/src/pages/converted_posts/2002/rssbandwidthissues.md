<p><a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/21.html#push_by_any_other_name">mark pilgrim points out that rss feeds are starting to take up a lot of bandwidth</a>. he says: <q>I specify in my main RSS feed that it should only be read every 3 hours, and secondary feeds only once a day.</q> i'm currently using netnewswire lite as my rss news reader (per <a href="http://diveintomark.org/xml/">mark's own suggestion</a>). unfortunately, netnewswire lite forgets everything it knows about a feed every time the application quits. so it doesn't matter how mark's rss tells readers that the content hasn't changed. my reader has to reload every time i re-launch it (even if it hasn't changed), or it won't have any news to show me. this is admittedly "rude" behavior on the part of netnewswire lite, and <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/925.html#c1035134428">sam ruby has suggested such rudeness should be dealt with harshly</a>. unfortunately, i don't think there are enough news readers out there yet (by which i mean both the applications and the people running them) for rss content providers to be so selective about their audiences.</p>
