<p>today i recorded the first usable rendition of a song i've been trying to record for about a month now, called "all your faith". i've posted it - in full - at <a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/">music.randomchaos.com</a>. after doing so, i noticed that the file was much bigger than the other full song (i thought) i had posted in full, "one more time". i guess i accidentally posted only the first few seconds of that song. so i've corrected that as well, which means two new full songs are available today. that's right - <a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/">free music. now go listen to it.</a></p>
