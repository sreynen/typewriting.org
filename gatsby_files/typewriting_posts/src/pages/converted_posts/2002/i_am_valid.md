<p>i wasn't really sure before, because i had no real means of testing. but now i know: <a href="http://feeds.archive.org/validator/check.cgi?url=http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?format=rss">my rss is valid</a>, as are all my xhtml pages, and my css - which means my whole website is valid - which makes me feel a bit more valid. <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">are you valid</a>?</p>
