<p>here's why you should read <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/20/magazine/20INEQUALITY.html" title="For Richer By PAUL KRUGMAN">this article</a>: "you can't understand what's happening in America today without understanding the extent, causes and consequences of the vast increase in inequality that has taken place over the last three decades, and in particular the astonishing concentration of income and wealth in just a few hands."</p><br><p>while you're reading it, think about what happened between the 1920's and the relatively egalitarian period of the 1950's and 60's (hint: great depression and world war II). now consider the state of the american economy and rising militarism. america's future is looking quite sad.</p>
