title: "Giving Seasoning"

In your last chance holiday errands, you may feel frustrated in shopping for that person in your life who has everything.  Don't forget the millions who have very little at all. Consider making a donation in honor of a loved one, or better yet, several donations.  Many charitable organizations make giving online convenient and secure. <a href="<br>https://secure.habitat.org/giving/online.html" title="Habitat for Humanity website.">Habitat for Humanity</a> accepts donations of time as well as money. Besides your online gift, you can bypass that trip to the mall and help a homeless family build their own home instead.  <br>Most importantly, remember non-profit sites even after the tree goes out to the curb. Then, when valentines and chocolates hit the shelves, remember <a href="http://www.safehavenministries.org/" title="Safe Haven Website.">domestic violence shelters.</a> When the Easter Bunny comes hopping, remember <a href="http://www.childrenscharities.org/" title="Childrens Charities website.">children's charities.</a> When you barbecue with the family for Mother's Day and for Father's Day, remind everyone about <a href="http://www.catholiccharitiesdov.org/NeedHelp/ElderlyServices/Default.htm" title="Elderly Services wesite.">elderly moms and dads</a> with no visitors. And before you sit down for turkey next November, point and click on <a href="http://www.thehungersite.org/" title="The Hunger Site">The Hunger Site.</a><br>Give the whole year round, and turn the giving season into giving seasoning. It tastes good at  every occasion.
