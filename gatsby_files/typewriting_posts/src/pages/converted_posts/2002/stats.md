i've set up a very basic <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/stats.php">stats page</a> for this subdomain. my host provides a nice <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/stats/">stats page</a> for my main www domain, but not for secondary subdomains. it also doesn't allow me to access that information programatically so that i can reuse it. so i can't currently do something like automatically linking back to sites that link to me. the new stats page will review the raw server logs and generate more readable information. to lower the strain on the server and the resulting time delay it will only update once per day, which should be often enough to get useful results. right now, the results are very basic, but it's a nice start.
