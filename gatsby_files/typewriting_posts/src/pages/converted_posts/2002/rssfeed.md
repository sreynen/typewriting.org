<p>this weblog now has a functioning rss feed, which can be accessed by following the 'RSS' link on each page. i've accessed the feed using <a href="http://ranchero.com/software/netnewswire/">netnewswire lite</a> (which, by the way, is a wonderful program) for mac os x, but i haven't yet been able to load it with <a href="http://www.disobey.com/amphetadesk/">amphetadesk</a>.</p>
