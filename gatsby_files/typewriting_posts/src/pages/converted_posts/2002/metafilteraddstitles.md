the number of news feeds i'm subscribed to has grown beyond that which i could actually read. so i skim. i skim by titles mostly. <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/">metafilter's</a> rss article titles used to be something like "posted by scott at 7:39 AM PST", which told me absolutely nothing about the content. so i had to open each article and do a more time consuming skim. this bothers me, but for some reason wasting away two hours of my life watching a bad action movie doesn't. but no more, because metafilter has now changed the titles to actually reflect the content of articles, and i am very grateful for the few seconds i will save each day.
