after <a href="http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/000780.html">that</a>, a young woman came in. halfway through the test, she mentioned that she had been out under the sun all day, and her eyes hadn't quite adjusted to indoor lighting yet. the optometrist assured her that he watched very carefully for a patient's sun tan, and weighed this into his prescriptions. he prescribed to her bi-focals, as she had expected, because her friend who had recommended that she visit this optometrist also wore bi-focals. just out of curiosity, she asked about progressive lenses.<br>"i only prescribe those to people who can't focus," he answered, "people who are easily distracted by meaningless details. and by the way, i noticed a few cat hairs on your shoes. i'm giving you special cat-friendly glasses."
