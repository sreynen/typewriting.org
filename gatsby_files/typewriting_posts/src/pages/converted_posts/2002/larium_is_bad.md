<p>one of my coworkers took larium before and during a trek around southeast asia. she just got back and has been having some scary side effects. <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=larium">a quick google search for larium</a> brings up plenty of information about scary stuff that can happen as a result of taking larium. of course, most of these stories sound better than the alternative of getting malaria, but it sounds like there are <a href="http://britishexpats.com/forum/showthread.php?threadid=53222">plenty of better alternative medicines</a>. so why is larium still being sold?</p>
