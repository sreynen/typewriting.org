<p>from <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A48750-2002Dec28.html">the washington post</a>: <q>Steel salvaged from the wreckage of the World Trade Center was headed to a Mississippi shipyard today for use in the USS New York, a warship named in honor of those who died in the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attack.</q> if i'm ever killed by terrorists, please don't honor me with more war. you can honor me with improved education and healthcare, or by protecting the lives of innocent people around the world, or just a simple plaque. but if there's one thing for which i don't want to be remembered after i'm killed, it's more killing.</p>
