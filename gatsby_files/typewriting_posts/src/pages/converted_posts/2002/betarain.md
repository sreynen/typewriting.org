<p>beta rain was a band at my high school. i didn't know anyone in the band very well, but the lead singer was a friend of a friend, and i liked their music when i heard it. so i borrowed some tapes in high school and recorded them as mp3 files. five years later, i've posted a clip of one of my favorite beta rain songs, blueser, to <a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/">music.randomchaos.com</a>. if it ever generates any donations, i'll track down the band and send them a check. enjoy.</p>
