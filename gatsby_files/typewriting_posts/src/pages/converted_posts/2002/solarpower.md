i've been reading about solar power. i started out looking for things i might like to get as christmas presents. i inhereted a solar-powered flashlight a roommate left in a former apartment. it's pretty neat. so i went looking for similar things. all i found was more <a href="http://www.global-merchants.com/home/solars.htm">solar lights and radios</a>. i don't really listen to the radio. but then i wandered into reading about <a href="http://www.mrsolar.com/faq.htm">solar powering a home</a>. definitely something i hope to do just as soon as i get a home. if you already have a home in the u.s., you might want to look at <a href="http://www.dsireusa.org/dsire/index.htm">your state's incentives for using renewable energy</a>.
