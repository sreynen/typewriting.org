<p>it's a trick known to most of my friends, but i realize you probably don't know it. and it's quite useful at times. when you find you've said something, just now, that you already regret - perhaps you stumbled into an argument or unintentionally insulted someone (most likely both) - when you wish you hadn't said what you just said -  you can say "i'm just saying, that's all." and it will, in all but the most extreme cases, just go away.</p><br><p>"so, how did your date go last night?"</p><br><p>"..."</p><br><p>"i'm just saying, that's all."</p>
