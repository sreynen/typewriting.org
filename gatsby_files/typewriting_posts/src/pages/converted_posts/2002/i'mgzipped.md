following <a href="http://www.textism.com/article/632/">a tip on textism</a>, all php pages on randomchaos.com are now gzipped for browsers supporting it. if you don't look <a href="http://leknor.com/code/gziped.php?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.randomchaos.com%2F">here</a>, you won't see any difference. but if you're using a browser produced in this century, you're probably getting randomchaos.com content a little faster, and with a tiny bit less strain on the internet.
