<p>after reading <a href="http://boingboing.net/#90076045">this boing boing article about immigration</a>, in which brit Danny O'Brien says <q>I'm joining the ACLU.</q>, i decided to do the same. i've long supported the ACLU (ideologically), and even tried (and failed) to start a chapter at my college, but i never actually joined before. <a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2002/12/11/131317/57">joining the ACLU seems to be a popular thing to do these days.</a> i guess i'm just following the trends.</p>
