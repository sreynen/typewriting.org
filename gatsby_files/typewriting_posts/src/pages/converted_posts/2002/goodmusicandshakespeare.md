my sophomore english teacher, mrs. stubbs, told me something about shakespeare that i still remember today. she said that shakespeare would write plays to be entertaining to various audiences at the same time. the plays would be entertaining to the drunken crowd on the floor, and also to the wealthy aristocrats in the balcony. i think good music works the same way. it has a good beat or a catchy melody that a drunken party can enjoy. and it also has a complexity of music or a depth of lyrics that more snooty people can enjoy.
