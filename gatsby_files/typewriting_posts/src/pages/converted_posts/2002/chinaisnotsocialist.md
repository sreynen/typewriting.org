title: "china is not socialist" 
---
<p>i'm sitting here watching the chinese communist party congress on asian cnn and i can hardly believe what i'm listening to: "socialism with chinese characteristics","following the basic principles of marxism","the socialist modernization drive", "our party will always remain a marxist party", etc. the only explanation i can come up with is that jiang zemin is unaware that china joined the world trade organizaion - the global capitalist club. someone should really clue him in: china is not socialist anymore.</p>
