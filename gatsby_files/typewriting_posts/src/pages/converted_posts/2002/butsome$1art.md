<p>my friend jon wrote me:<br><blockquote>i know you've got world-wide fame and clout, so<br>mention my website to everyone you know, link to my website, tell the press,<br>because i got this crazy-ass art project going on, and i need people to<br>support it.</blockquote><br>this would be just a shameless plus, except that <a href="http://www.jonponder.com/">his art project actually is "crazy-ass"</a> (he's drawing 1000 pictures in a week and selling them for only $1 each) and i like his art, so i would be linking to him even if i didn't know him personally (except that i wouldn't know about the project). but as an added bonus, he's a nice guy who deserves your money (not that you don't).</p>
