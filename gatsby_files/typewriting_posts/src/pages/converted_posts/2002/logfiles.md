i discovered today that my server's log files are compressed every two months and new log files are begun. so <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/stats.php">the stats page</a> right now looks rather empty. this is another good reason to update the stats and updatestats pages so that they create and link to archived stats from previous months - something i should have done already anyway.
