<p>i'm updating the stats.php pages (for all the domains) tonight. it took me about an hour to find any sort of remotely complete <a href="http://www.pgts.com.au/pgtsj/pgtsj0208d.html">list of http user-agent strings and the related browsers/bots</a>. so i'm writing this in hopes that search engines will pick it up and some day i'll save someone else some time.</p>
