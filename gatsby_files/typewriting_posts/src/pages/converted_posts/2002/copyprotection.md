<p>if i ever wanted to do anything other than watch digital video - like maybe watch the movie i bought in hong kong back in america, or watch the movie my mom bought me in america and mailed to me in taiwan, or copy a movie to vhs so my grandma can watch it at home, or do a study of gesture use in film and add text notes to the bottom of the video, or whatever - i would buy one of the $3 bootleg vcds they sell at the local market every weekend rather than a $15 dvd of the same thing. the dvd has a menu of options and copy protection. and generally i'm willing to pay the extra $12 for the menu, but not when i have to put up with the copy protection. this is the effect copy protection has on my video purchasing habits - none or negative.</p>
