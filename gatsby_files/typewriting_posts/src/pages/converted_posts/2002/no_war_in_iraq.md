It is rather awareness that the world is being sold a bill of goods: one that is apparently having some success convincing people the invasion has anything to do with the restoration of democracy anywhere, or the war against al Qaida, or revenge for the attacks of 11 September, or weapons of mass distruction, or the protection of Israel, or some sort of effort at modernizing Islam, or, most gallingly of all, 'regime change' for the good of the Iraqi people.</q></p>
