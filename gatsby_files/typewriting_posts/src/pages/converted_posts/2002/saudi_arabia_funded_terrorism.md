During the first 7 months of 2002, Saudi Arabia supplied the United States with 1.5 million barrels per day of crude oil, or 17%, of U.S. crude oil imports during that period." <a href="http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/iraq.html">on the other hand</a>, "it appears that in recent months more Iraqi oil (close to three-quarters) has been exported via Mina al-Bakr rather than via Ceyhan, in part due to a shift in oil exports away from Europe and the United States and towards Asia."</p><br><p>that difference is translated into an american scramble to protect the image americans have of saudi arabia, and to damage that of iraq. if the white house was attacking countries on the basis of their ties to terrorism, they would be attacking saudi arabia rather than iraq. but instead they're attacking countries based on oil interests.</p>
