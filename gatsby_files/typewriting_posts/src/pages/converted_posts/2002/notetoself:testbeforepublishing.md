<p>there are times when i will make a quick fix to some application, upload it, and everything will work. but it's almost certain that the times when i do not make a temporary copy of the application, and instead replace the live version of the application without testing it will not be one of these times. at these times, more often, the "quick fix" i made turns out to be a "quick break" which turns into a "long fix" during which the application that was previously mostly working with one minor bug is not working at all.</p>
