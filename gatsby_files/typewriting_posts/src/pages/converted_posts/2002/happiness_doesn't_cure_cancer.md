<p>apparently cancer doesn't care if you're happy: <q><a href="http://abcnews.go.com/wire/Living/ap20021020_1207.html">New research has dealt a blow to the idea that a positive outlook might improve a patient's chances of surviving cancer</a>.</q> on the other hand, happy people with cancer are still better off than depressed people with cancer. but there is now one less reason to be depressed about being depressed.</p>
