title: "cannabis is worse than tobacco"

<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2419713.stm">the bbc reports</a>: "Evidence shows that tar from cannabis cigarettes contains 50% more cancer causing carcinogens than tobacco." a surprise to me. i wonder if the same is true for second-hand cannabis smoke, because i think drug (il)legalization should be based on the real effects a drug has on others. if people don't mind hurting themselves for a little short-term pleasure, there are more ways to do this than anyone could enforcably prohibit. but i assume second-hand smoke would also be more harmful, so this news <i>does</i> change my opinion of legalizing marijuana slightly - maybe it should only be legal to use in private.</p>
