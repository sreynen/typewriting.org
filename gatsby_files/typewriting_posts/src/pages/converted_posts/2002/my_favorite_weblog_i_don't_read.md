<p>i think <a href="http://www.zeldman.com/daily/"><cite>jeffrey zeldman</cite></a> probably has the best weblog i don't read. i only occasionally stumble upon weblogs that i would read except they don't have <abbr>RSS</abbr> feeds, and i generally email the author and alert them of this (i think) lack. but i'm sure jeffrey zeldman knows all about <abbr>RSS</abbr> and has made a decision to not use it, which is a shame because of all the weblogs i don't read, i think his is my favorite.</p>
