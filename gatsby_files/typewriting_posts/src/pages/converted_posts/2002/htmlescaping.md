<p>when i went to read my first daily japanese lesson this morning in my newsreader, i found there is an error in the RSS version. the web version worked fine, but the RSS version needs to have html code escaped. unfortunately, i'm not sure i can do this without screwing up the japanese text, because most text-editing functions in php don't by default support multi-byte languages (such as japanese), and i don't have the ability to reconfigure and reinstall php on my host.</p>
