<p>it appears <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2002-11-29&amp;title=the+painful+irony">the flood of irony</a> has reached a high tide, and finally begun to ebb. <a href="http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=42E52739-4309-4962-A65AF109738F3E77">voice of america</a> reports: "Henry Kissinger stepped down Friday as chairman of a panel investigating last year's New York and Washington terrorist attacks." apparently there was speculation that there might be a conflict-of-interest with kissinger's consulting firm. still, the press hasn't pointed out the obvious conflict-of-interest regarding <a href="http://www.fair.org/activism/kissinger-crimes.html">kissinger's crimes against humanity</a>.</p>
