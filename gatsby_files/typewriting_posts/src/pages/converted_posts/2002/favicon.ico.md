<p>if you are using a browser supporting the favicon.ico scheme, you should now see a two-way traffic sign as the logo for randomchaos.com. after much playing around with iconographer, i settled on this design because it is 1) recognizable at the small size, and 2) relatively vague in meaning. i wanted something that was more than just a pretty image, but not much more. i think this does the job well.</p>
