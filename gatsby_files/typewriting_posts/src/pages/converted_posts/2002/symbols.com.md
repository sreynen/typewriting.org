there was a time when i would say to myself, "i need to know about whales. i know - i'll go to whales.com!" but now it's generally a safe assumption that any commonly used word has been co-opted as a corporate trademark.  whales.com will only provide you with useful information if you happen to be wanting to do whale watching near canada. <a href="http://www.symbols.com/">symbols.com</a>, on the other hand, contains information on - you guessed it - symbols.
