<p>unfortunately, <a href="http://www.directnic.org/search/index.cgi?q=infuturo.org&amp;search=linguatron">infuturo.org was already taken</a>. otherwise, i probably would have grabbed it. i came across the latin phrase looking through the dictionary today. that's something you don't get with dictionary.com - surprises. by the way, <a href="http://www.ingurgitate.net/">ingurgitate.net is taken</a>. what a terrible domain name.</p>
