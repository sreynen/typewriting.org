<a href="http://live.curry.com/2002/11/21.html#a2637">adam curry</a> quotes <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quotes.php3?author=Oliver+Wendell+Holmes">Oliver Wendell Holmes</a> : "Don't flatter yourself that friendship authorizes you to say disagreeable things to your intimates. The nearer you come into relation with a person, the more necessary do tact and courtesy become. Except in cases of necessity, which are rare, leave your friend to learn unpleasant things from his enemies; they are ready enough to tell them." so true.
