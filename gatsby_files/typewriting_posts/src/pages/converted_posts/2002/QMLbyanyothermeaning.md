title: "QML by any other meaning"

it was only after publishing a "<abbr title="Quotation Markup Language">QML</abbr>" standard that i thought to check who else was using that acronym. unfortunately, <abbr>QML</abbr> is the "Quest Markup Language", "Queensland Medical Laboratory", the "Question Markup Language", the "Query Markup Language", a "Qualified Manufacturer List", the "Quality of Service Modeling<br>Language", the "Questions Markup Language" (note: not the same as the "Question Markup Language"), and <a href="http://www.telcorinc.com/qml.html">"Quick-Multi-Linc", which is trademarked</a>. ah well, what's another QML going to hurt?<br>on the upside, <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/dyn/moreinfo/macosx/17629">QuotEdit is now listed on versiontracker</a>, and it already has one mostly positive comment with a bit of well-deserved constructive criticism regarding the save-file process. i'll either fix that, or more likely <a href="http://mpt.phrasewise.com/2002/12/29#a428">do away with it entirely</a> in the next version.
