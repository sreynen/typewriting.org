<p>there are many times in the past year when i have wondered whether the headlines i'm reading are comedy or reality. <a href="http://www.fas.org/sgp/news/2002/02/dod022602.html">the pentagon suggests a department of lies and then says it won't happen</a>. <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2002-10-04&amp;title=bush-sadam+duel">iraq challenges bush to a duel</a>. but this one takes the cake: <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2002/11/27/national1010EST0553.DTL<br>">Henry Kissinger has been named head of the 'independent commission' to investigate the Sept. 11 attacks</a>. <a href="http://www.fair.org/activism/kissinger-crimes.html">henry kissinger was charged with war crimes</a>. i can't imagine a *worse* choice to head a probe on terrorism.</p>
