<p><a href="http://cashets.com/settingup.html">cashets</a> looks great. it's monetary transactions of as little as $0.02, free for the buyer, and only a 1 percent charge for the seller. i can't count how many times i've wanted to view just one article from a subscription website. i don't want to pay a yearly subscription fee to view just one article. but i would pay a disproportionately large fraction of that fee to view just one article. it's a win-win. i win by getting to view the article and not paying much for it, and the publisher wins by getting money from me they would not otherwise see.</p><br><p>actually, of more concern to me is the opposite scenario, in which i am the seller. now i can sell my music for about $0.50 per song (+shipping), burn it on cd, and mail it off. this system, however, would require a minimum purchase to cover blank cd costs. a better system would be to simply send customers mp3 files (since most of them would just rip the cd back to mp3 anyway). this is going to be my next project. maybe in a month or so, you'll be able to buy custom cds of music from me and some of my friends at music.randomchaos.com (which doesn't yet exist).</p>
