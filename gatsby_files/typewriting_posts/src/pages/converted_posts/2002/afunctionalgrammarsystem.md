title: "a functional grammar system"

i've been working on <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/poetry.php">a project</a> for over a week now and i just tonight made it do something remotely useful. it can give you a good number (28) of grammatically correct sentences that contain only the words 'a','the','fish','cat','ate',and 'quickly'. it's not particularly useful, but it's a nice start. it's still quite slow, and it breaks easily, but maybe you can "smell what i'm cookin'".
