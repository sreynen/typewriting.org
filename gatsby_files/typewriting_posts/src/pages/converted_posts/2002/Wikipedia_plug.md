<p>i think i've learned more in the last twenty minutes or so than i did during the rest of this week. the <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/">wikipedia</a> is one of those sites that alone make a 24/7 internet connection a worthwhile investment. it's a free, simple, comprehensive encyclopedia. i've been clicking on the "random page" option and learning much about all sorts of topics.</p>
