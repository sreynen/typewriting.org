<a href="http://www.googlism.com/">googlism</a> will return natural language results to natural language questions, by running them through google. unfortunately, it still thinks <a href="http://www.googlism.com/index.htm?ism=scott+reynen&amp;type=1">"scott reynen is a senior international studies major"</a>. on the other hand, it has enough personality to suggest that <a href="http://www.googlism.com/index.htm?ism=george+bush&amp;type=1">"george bush is a monkey"</a> and that <a href="http://www.googlism.com/index.htm?ism=al+gore&amp;type=1">"al gore is our president"</a>.
