<p>i think prescription drugs are basically the same as illegal drugs in that we don't really understand the effects they can have on our bodies, and our bodies are not built to process these substances in the quantities in which we commonly consume them. this is just my 'gut feeling', but it's strong enough that i've probably only taken aspirin three or four times since i was old enough to refuse it. every once in a while, this feeling gets validated; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/2349593.stm">the bbc reports</a>: <q>Parents are being told not to give aspirin to children under 16, because of possible links to a rare disease that attacks the brain and liver.</q> i can't help wondering: what about having lived sixteen years suddenly makes taking aspirin safe again?</p>
