not really. dave winer (and i'm not going to link to dave winer on principal) says "Mark Pilgrim reports that the optimizations that UserLand and other aggregator developers deployed in the last few weeks have saved him substantially on bandwidth costs." the thing is, mark hasn't written on <a href="http://diveintomark.org/">his weblog</a> in the last few weeks, so this bandwidth statistic may be skewed. anyway, that got me looking through mark's statistics pages and <a href="http://diveintomark.org/stats/searches.html">the page of incoming searches</a> has a surprising number of searching for "hey everybody i'm looking at gay porn" or something very similar. following <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=hey+everybody+i%27m+looking+at+gay+porn">this search on google</a> shows that mark does indeed come up on the first results page for <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/28.html">a post he wrote on referrer spamming</a>. it seems he fell into the same trap i did by discussing an odd text in his logs thereby causing it to turn up more in his logs. and now i'm doing my part to increase this trend by talking about it more.<br>i could go on and make analogies to quantum particles that change when you observe them, but instead i'll say that i want to know why mark pilgrim hasn't written for two weeks because i miss his writing.
