<p><a href="http://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/2002_12_22_seanmcgrath_archive.html#90083547">sean mcgrath</a> asks <q>Maybe we need a mechanism for marking up anti-links?</q> no, we don't. people who say something widely offensive may get a short term boost in negative attention via links, but such people can seldom sustain interesting conversation. soon enough, their fifteen minutes of web fame will pass and we will all go back to linking to the people who constructively challenge us. the last thing the internet needs is coded method of spreading negativity.</p>
