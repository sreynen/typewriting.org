i don't take most "what X am i" tests i come across, and of those i do take, the results are rarely worth noting. but <a href="http://rumandmonkey.com/widgets/tests/homosexual/">the "Which Famous Homosexual Are You?" test</a> sounded interesting, and it actually was. it turns out i am eleanor roosevelt. i had no idea eleanor roosevelt was gay. i'm happy to be eleanor roosevelt.
