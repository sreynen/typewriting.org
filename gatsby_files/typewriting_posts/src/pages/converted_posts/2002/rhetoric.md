<p>i suppose it's fitting that there is <a href="http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/">a name for everything in rhetoric</a>. for example, <a href="http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Figures/T/tmesis.htm">tmesis</a> is "Interjecting a word or phrase between parts of a compound word or between syllables of a word." and <a href="http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Figures/M/mesarchia.htm">mesarchia</a> is "The repetition of the same word or words at the beginning and middle of successive sentences." my students practice mesarchia all the time. and i'm not even going to mention <a href="http://humanities.byu.edu/rhetoric/Figures/P/paralipsis.htm">paralipsis</a>.</p>
