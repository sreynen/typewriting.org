title: "defining my topic"

on <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/index.shtml#85709177">plasticbag</a>:"Sometimes I think it would be much easier to write a site - you know - *about* something..." me too. <a href="http://jrobb.userland.com/2002/11/20.html#a2879">john robb</a> says "My advice:  find a topic, blog it, own it." so what is *my* topic? my first inclination is to answer that i don't have one. but last night i realized i do. everything i write is influenced by my dreams of and desire for a techno-utopia. i believe technological advancement leads society in a mostly consistant direction toward a future i view optimistically. so i write about technology because i think it's pushing us (or it's how we're pushing ourselves) and i write about peace and justice issues because i think the sooner we start adopting these conventions of behavior, the faster we will reach this techno-utopia.<br>just to clarify, i don't mean for 'utopia' to imply a world in which there are no problems, but only a world in which our problems are not fundamental to our very survival - a world in which life and liberty are generally secure and we can get down to the important business of pursuing happiness. and in a sort of complementary fashion, i believe both our wisdom (technology) and our compassion (peace, justice, etc.) will ultimately get us there.
