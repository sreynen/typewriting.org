<p>when i saw the title of this cnn article, i thought i must be misunderstanding it: "<a href="http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/meast/10/03/iraq.bush.duel/index.html">W.H. rejects Bush-Saddam duel offer</a>", but sure enough, iraq actually made an offer to settle the differences with a duel, and the white house rejected the offer.</p><br><p>i'm no fan of iraqi politics, but i can't think of a better (or more funny) way of pointing out the absurdity of bush's determination to go to war when a wide variety of less costly (both in lives and money) solutions have not yet been explored. bush is willing to risk the lives of thousands of americas, and take the lives of thousands of iraqis, rather than accept the duel offer and settle the whole thing with a simple sword fight. i'm sure no poll has been taken, but i suspect the american public would overwhelmingly prefer to see our leader single-handedly take on sadam  on espn than to watch another war on cnn. </p>
