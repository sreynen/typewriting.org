<p><a href="http://mpt.phrasewise.com/stories/storyReader$374">matthew thomas writes <cite><br>When good interfaces go crufty</cite></a>, a nice rundown of os/application interface problems. i'm probably going to be releasing a mac os x application this week. maybe if anyone uses it, i'll get rid of "save" and "open". getting rid of "quit" seems a little harsh to me. i don't really want to have to wait for my application to restart every time i change applications. sure, some applications start almost instantly, but others do not, and i switch around a lot.</p>
