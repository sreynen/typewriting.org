<p>here's a product description for something i'd like to make some day if someone else doesn't make it first:<blockquote>While You Were Away is an application for tracking numbers in web pages. You can give it a website address (URL), the text surrounding the number of interest, and a template sentence to put the number into, and it will track the number, and give you updates whenever it changes.</blockquote><br>for example, you could give it the following information:<ul><br><li>name = "Google: scott reynen"</li><br><li>url = "http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;q=scott+reynen"</li><br><li>before_text = "of about"</li><br><li>after_text = ". Search took"</li><br><li>math = "x-x.previous"</li><br><li>sentence: "Google found {x} new results for 'scott reynen'."</li><br><li>show_if = "x > 25"</li><br></ul><br>and whenever there was an increase of 25 or more in the number of results google returned for that query, the application would tell you <q>While you were away... Google found 46 new results for 'scott reynen'</q>, as well as any other queries you'd set up, with links to the related URLs. if there was nothing new, it would tell you <q>While you were away... not much happened.</q> or if the parameters no longer matched a number, it would tell you <q>While you were away... Google: scott reynen stopped working.</q> i can imagine a wide variety of useful ways of applying such an application.</p>
