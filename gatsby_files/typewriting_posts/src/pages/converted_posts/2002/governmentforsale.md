<a href="http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/business/columnists/dan_gillmor/ejournal/4576523.htm">dan gillmor</a> writes "The correct word for what has happened here is 'theft' -- because the government has allowed private interests to steal from the public domain." the government *should* be funding something like <a href="http://www.gutenberg.net/">project gutenberg</a> for useful government documents. previously, the largest obstacle to gaining access to public documents (i.e. documents paid for by taxes) was the costs of printing and shipping. with digital technology, that's no longer a valid excuse. it isn't that the government has suddenly become a servant of the private sector rather than citizens, but just that technological development makes this servitude more obvious.
