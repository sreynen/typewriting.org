<p>my previous post used the &lt;q&gt; tag instead of quote characters. it displays fine in my very limited (two-browser,single-platform) testing environment. unless i come across any terrible problems with this, i'm going to start using it all the time for inline quotes. yet another step on the path to a well-structured weblog.</p>
