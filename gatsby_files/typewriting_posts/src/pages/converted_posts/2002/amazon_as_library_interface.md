<p>jon udell has created <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/gems/lib.html">a neat tool for quickly checking libraries in north america for books by ISBN</a>. all this needs is <a href="http://www.cryptnet.net/fsp/zipdy/">some geographic location data for each library</a>, and a <a href="http://www.onfocus.com/bookwatch/BookPost_info.asp">bookmarklet to parse an amazon URL for ISBN</a>, and he'll have a wonderful tool allowing anyone to use amazon's recommendations to find books at local libraries. if you follow the previous links, you'll discover that all of the required parts of this tool already exist. someone just needs to put them all together.</p>
