<p>i updated the <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/japanese.php">daily japanese lessons</a> so you can view them all at once, or go through them lesson-by-lesson. i also changed the back=n functionality to a startdate=yyyy-mm-dd functionality. anyone who subscribed to or bookmarked the back=n urls (which i believe is precisely no one) will need to change their links. i was looking at adding &lt;link rel="next"...&gt; type links, and i wanted to test them out, but i couldn't find any information on chimera's support for such links. i also couldn't find any information about chimera's support for the accesskey attribute.</p><br><p>anyway, i was looking for such information on <a href="http://diveintoaccessibility.org/">dive into accessibility</a> (i didn't find it) when i found a link to <a href="http://www.delorie.com/web/lynxview.html">lynx viewer</a>, which shows you what a website looks like in a text-only browser. so i tested this weblog and i think <a href="http://www.delorie.com/web/lynxview.cgi?url=http%3A%2F%2Fweblog.randomchaos.com">it actually looks better</a> than the html version. this is good news because it shows that my use of css for layouts has left me with clean and simple xhtml files that make sense structurally. on the other hand, i probably need to improve my css skills so that my styles add to the user experience rather than taking away from it.</p>
