<p>the democrat leadership is <a href="http://www.busybusybusy.com/b3_arc_02_1104.shtml#November62002100AMPT">reportedly</a> pleased with the election results and confident of a win in 2004: <q>voters aren't stupid. Once they realize that I agree with the president on everything, and that I'm much better looking, naturally they'll vote for me instead.</q></p>
