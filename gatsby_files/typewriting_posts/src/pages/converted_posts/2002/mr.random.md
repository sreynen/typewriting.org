<p>mr. random is linking to this weblog from <a href="http://www.efn.org/~fletk/">his weblog</a>. why? i think it's because this weblog has the word "random" in its title, but maybe there's some bigger connection i'm missing. <a href="http://www.efn.org/~fletk/mrrandom.html">who is mr. random?</a> i'm not sure, but he says <q>I liked using technology and industrial methods to generate art</q> and i like that too. he has some poetry in his weblog that looks like it could have been made by my old random poetry generator. i need to get that running again, so people like mr. random can enjoy it.</p>
