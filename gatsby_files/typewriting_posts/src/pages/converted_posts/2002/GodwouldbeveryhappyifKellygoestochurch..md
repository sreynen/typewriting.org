<p><a href="http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/000767.html" title="God would be very happy if Kelly goes to church.">the statement</a> "it's good to go to church" is not true. it's not false either. it's variable. going to church is, among other things, a ritual. rituals are at best means of forming habits of healthy behavior. at worst, they become substitutes for the very healthy behaviors they were meant to habitualize. but it seems to me that for most people they tend toward the worse.</p>
