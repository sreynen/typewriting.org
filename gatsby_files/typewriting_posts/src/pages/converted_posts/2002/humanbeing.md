title: "human being"

every so often i read a short description of someone beginning with "human being". reading this causes me to immediately sympathize with the person in the same way "juggler","vegetarian", or any other common characteristic would. it's not like i don't realize everyone else is a human being. but if the first item in a description is "dentist", my first reaction is "that's not me". if the first item is "human being", not only is my first reaction "oh - we have something in common", but that is *everyone's* first reaction. the effect would probably lesson if it were used more often, but it works on me every time.
