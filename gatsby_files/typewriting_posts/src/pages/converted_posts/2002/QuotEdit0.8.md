<p><a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/qml/quotedit/">QuotEdit</a> is my mac os x application for editing quotation compilations, and saving them as XML (QML) documents. the whole reason i made it was to allow myself to be able to create content for a game i want to make (cryptoquotes and quote falls), but it was a good project for teaching me about REALbasic, dealing with XML, and interface design. i'm sure i have <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2002-12-29&amp;title=why+interfaces+are+bad">much to learn and improve</a>, but i'm releasing this now because it's usable for me. if anyone else wants further improvements, i'll be happy to make them; if not, i'm moving on to the game. i suspect the market for a game is somewhat larger than the market for quotation editors, if the latter even exists.</p>
