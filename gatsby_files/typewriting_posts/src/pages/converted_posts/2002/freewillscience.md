<p><a href="http://www.boston.com/dailyglobe2/288/science/A_question_of_willP.shtml">neuroscientists experiment with free will</a>:</p><br><blockquote><p>A subject, he said, would be repeatedly prompted to choose to move either his right or his left hand. Normally, right-handed people would move their right hands about 60 percent of the time.</p><br><p>Then the experimenters would use magnetic stimulation in certain parts of the brain just at the moment when the subject was prompted to make the choice. They found that the magnets, which influence electrical activity in the brain, had an enormous effect: On average, subjects whose brains were stimulated on their right-hand side started choosing their left hands 80 percent of the time.</p><br><p>And, in the spookiest aspect of the experiment, the subjects still felt as if they were choosing freely.</p></blockquote><br><p>that is spooky.</p>
