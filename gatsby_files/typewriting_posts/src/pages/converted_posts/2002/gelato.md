i am aghast that i went through almost 23 years of my life believing that ice cream was pretty much the end of road for creamy frozen food innovation. just today: enter <a href="http://www.googlism.com/what_is/g/gelato/">gelato</a>. if you haven't tried gelato, you should. (these things are fun, and fun is good.) you can find <a href="http://www.howler.com/WhereToBuy.html">Howler's organic gelato at independent grocers</a>, but i haven't been able to find any more information about buying gelato outside of italy. what i can tell you from personal experience is that there is a gelato store in the food court of the sogo department store in hsinchu, taiwan.
