i don't like RSS feeds that provide a few lines of content and then trail off with ... i realize that the original use of RSS was to provide a teaser of actual content. but at this point it seems RSS has progressed beyond that, and this practice of using RSS as a teaser to me is analogous to an online version of a newspaper that only publishes the first paragraph of every article and ends with the phone number you can call to order a paper subscription. the people who don't use the technology aren't going to be impressed that you have a website (or RSS feed), and the people who do use the technology (e.g. me) are just going to be annoyed that you're not exercising its full potential. i know there's nothing technologically stopping you with RSS, so give me the content (please).
