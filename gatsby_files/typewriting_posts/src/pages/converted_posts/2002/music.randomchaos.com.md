<p><a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/">music.randomchaos.com</a> is operational, but just barely. there are currently two full songs and eight sample mp3s available for download. the cashets donation system has zero documentation, so that's not very user-friendly. you'd have to have an account at cashets to be a buyer (or donor), but the donation submission form doesn't say this. it just asks you for your password with no explanation. so i'm not expecting to make anything. but the system is there to distribute music with fair compensation, and it will only improve.</p>
