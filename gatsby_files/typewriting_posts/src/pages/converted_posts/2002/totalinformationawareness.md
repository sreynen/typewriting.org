i've read many people's expressions of concern over DARPA's information awareness office's planned "Total Information Awareness" project. most people are ignoring IAO claims that "The goal of the Total Information Awareness (TIA) program is to revolutionize the ability of the United States to detect, classify and identify <i>foreign</i> terrorists" (emphasis added) and talking about how this will be used to spy (more) on US citizens. this is understandable, given how easily the TIA project falls into an orwellian scenario of a totalitarian government.<br>i remember hearing an argument that went something like this: they're going to watch us no matter what. the only question is whether we can also watch us. i'm not entirely convinced the first half is true, but events of the past year have eroded my hopes in this area. what i'm interested in is the second half. assuming this TIA program goes through (tangent: i don't think government agencies should be allowed to publish information about programs still pending approval), why not focus energy on demanding that the information collected be publicly available? or, put another way, would it really be so bad for the government to know everything about everyone, if <i>everyone</i> could know everything about everyone? that scenario doesn't trouble me so much.
