<p><a href="http://www.rtlabs.com/macsql/">MacSQL</a> is nice, but <a href="http://www.versiontracker.com/moreinfo.fcgi?id=10887&amp;db=mac">CocoaSQL</a> is free. CocoaSQL doesn't return error messages, or give any response to anything but select statements, or do a whole list of other things that i enjoyed in MacSQL before the trial period ended. but CocoaSQL does everything I need it to do, and it's free.</p>
