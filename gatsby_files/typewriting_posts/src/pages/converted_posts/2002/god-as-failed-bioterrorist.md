<p><a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/index.shtml#90051804">tom makes two points today on the failures of the "gay plague"</a>. first, <q>that gay women are far far less likely to contract or spread HIV than almost anyone else</q>. and second, <q> that people who have had unprotected anal sex are more able to transmit HIV than other people - whether they be straight, gay, men, women or anywhere in between...</q> it's not just a god-as-bioterrorist theology, but a god-as-failed-bioterrorist theology required to support the idea of a "gay plague".</p>
