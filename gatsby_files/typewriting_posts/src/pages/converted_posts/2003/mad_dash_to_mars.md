<p>the title of <a href="http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/01/18/1042520819544.html">this article, <q>NASA plans two-month manned dash to Mars</q></a>, brought to my mind pictures of a reality tv show in which two separate <abbr title="National Aeronautics &amp; Space Administration">NASA</abbr> missions head for mars. whoever gets there first "wins", and the world gets to watch it all on tv, helping to pay for the missions. of course, that's not what the article is about, but that's what i was thinking.</p>
