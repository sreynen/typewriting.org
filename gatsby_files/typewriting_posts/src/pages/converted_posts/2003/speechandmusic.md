<p>on <a href="http://www.boston.com/news/globe/ideas/articles/2003/11/09/songs_of_ourselves/">the boston globe</a>:</p><br><blockquote>Using a database of over 100,000 brief segments of speech, they noted which frequency had the greatest emphasis in each sound. The resulting set of frequencies, they discovered, corresponded closely to the chromatic scale. In short, the building blocks of music are to be found in speech.</blockquote><br><p>why is that assumed over the alternative conclusion, that the building blocks of speech are to be found in music? either way, interesting stuff.</p>
