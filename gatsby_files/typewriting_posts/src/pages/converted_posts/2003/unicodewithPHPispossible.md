<p>after <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2003-10-11&amp;title=PHP+does+have+limited+unicode+support">yesterday's post</a> in which i attempted to suggest that joel was wrong about PHP, my favorite weblogger, <a href="http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/2003/10/there_aint_no_such_thing_as_plain_text.php">jonathon delacour, accepted joel's statements as truth</a>:</p><br><blockquote>I wish Joel Spolsky had published his excellent <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html">introduction to Unicode and character encoding</a> a week earlier, because then I wouldn't have wasted a couple of hours trying to write a snippet of PHP code to convert Japanese characters to Unicode character entities.</blockquote><br><p>so today i wrote <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/language/japanese-unicode.php?japanese=%E3%81%8A%E8%8C%B6%E6%BC%AC%E3%81%91%E3%81%AE%E5%91%B3">a snippet of PHP code to convert japanese characters to unicode character entities</a>. now i think we must either conclude that <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2003/10/10.html">joel was wrong</a> about it being <q>darn near impossible to develop good international web applications</q> or i am somehow capable of performing the impossible. i'll be satisfied with either conclusion.</p>
