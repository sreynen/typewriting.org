<p><q>Some fanatical vegetarians insist they could never eat meat...</q> is it just me, or does this sentence seem ridiculous to anyone else? ignore for a moment <a href="http://entertainment.tv.yahoo.com/entnews/wwn/20030516/105309720008.html">the context of this statement (meat trees)</a>, and try to concentrate on what the word "vegetarian" means. there are, of course, <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=vegetarian">a variety of definitions for the word</a>, but they all indicate that vegetarians *do not eat meat*. why, then, is it "fanatical" for a vegetarian to *not eat meat*? i dread the day when "meat-eating vegetarian" becomes part of our vocabulary. that's right up there with "war is peace" on the list of ideas that will drive me mad. i guess i'm just "fanatical" about words meaning *something*.</p>
