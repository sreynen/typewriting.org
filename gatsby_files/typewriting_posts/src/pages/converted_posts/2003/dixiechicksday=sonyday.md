<a href="http://www.geocities.com/bhampeace/">the birmingham peace project</a> says <q>Birmingham Peace Project invites you to join with us on June 7, 2003 as we celebrate Dixie Chicks Day. It is our hope that every man, woman and child around the world will support the Dixie Chicks on this day by going to their favorite retail outlet and buying at least one of the band's CDs.</q><br>That's a nice idea, but perhaps not the best way to show support. Most (<a href="http://www.emeraldbayrecords.com/contract_comparison.shtml">up to 90%</a>) of the money spent on a Dixie Chicks CD will go to the Dixie Chicks' record company, Sony Music, who remained silent while the Dixie Chicks were being censored. Sony could have taken a stand against censorship by exercising their <a href="http://pbskids.org/dontbuyit/entertainment/makingmusic.html">enormous influence over radio stations</a>. Instead they did nothing, which is somewhat understandable, given that the Dixie Chicks have been <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1514747.stm">trying to get out of their contract</a> with Sony (claiming Sony was defrauding them) for the last two years.<br>I'm afraid this action will do more to help Sony Music, which passively endorsed the censorship, than to help the Dixie Chicks, who suffered from it.
