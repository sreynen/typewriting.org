<p>i've made a few changes around the site. if you look at <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/recent.php">the list of recent changes</a>, you'll see that the vast majority of everything on the server was edited today. it was brought to my attention that this site is difficult to navigate. so i'm doing a site-wide clean-up and reorganization. the major change so far was doing away with the style switcher, which had prevented me from making changes in the past, for fear of how they might affect the various styles (which few were using anyway). so now there's just one style. if you don't like it (and you're alpha-geek enough), you can still apply your own style sheet to the site, but i'll be focusing my limited design skills on a single style from here on out.</p>
