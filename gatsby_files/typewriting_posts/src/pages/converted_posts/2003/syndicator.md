<p>i grabbed the <a href="http://www.bitfolge.de/?l=en&amp;s=rsscreator">rsscreator class from kai blankenhorn</a>, improved it a bit, and added experimental "pie" support. so if you happen to have a news reader for <a href="http://intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/ProjectNameProposals">the format that would not be named</a>, you can now use it to read this weblog. i renamed the class "syndicator" to reflect that it's no longer rss-specific. i also plan to add mbox support. as with everything on randomchaos.com, you can <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/source.php?source=http%3A%2F%2Fweblog.randomchaos.com%2Fsyndicator.inc">see the source</a>.</p>
