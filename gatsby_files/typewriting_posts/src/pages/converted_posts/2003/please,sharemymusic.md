<a href="http://funkbunny.com/datatype/archives/000049.html">emmett plant wrote a nice letter to congress</a> about why a bill intented to protect musicians actually does the opposite. as an <a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/">independent musician</a>, i completely agree. i'm not giving *all* of my music away for free like plant is, but what i do give away for free, i *want* to be freely shared on peer-to-peer networks. please, share my music.
