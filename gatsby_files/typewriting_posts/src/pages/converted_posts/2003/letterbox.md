<p>the first release of <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/software/letterbox/">letter box</a>, a mac os x word game i've been working on for a few months, is now available. it's small and (i think) fun. go download it, and give me some feedback. or if you're feeling particularly generous, you could even register it. this is my first shareware product. i'm not really expecting to make any money from this particular release, but i expect the 1.0 release will be my first profitable software.</p>
