<p><a href="http://www.apple.com/music/store/">apple's new music store</a> is certainly an improvement over what previously existed. now there is a simple and relatively cheap way to pay for music per song. and it's not outright theft, which is a step up from file sharing. but it's not really much better for musicians, who are still getting <a href="http://www.emeraldbayrecords.com/contract_comparison.shtml">a small fraction of what they deserve</a>. apple says <q>...all five major record labels are in play. And since it?s legal, you know the artists are getting paid for their work.</q> ha. since *only* all five major record labels are in play, you know the artists are *not* getting paid for their work. fortunately, if apple's store becomes successful, more musicians will realize that the record companies aren't really doing anything for all the money they take. then maybe apple will start selling music for independent musicians, who have this crazy idea that they should be getting paid more for their music than the people who package it. or maybe someone will clone apple's store and make it available to anyone.</p>
