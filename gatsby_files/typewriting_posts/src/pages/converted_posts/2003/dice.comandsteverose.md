<p>on request, i've added dice.com support to the <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/">job feeds</a>. because dice.com has a much less transparent interface, you can't just copy and paste a search URL like you can with monster.com and hotjobs.com, so the searches are currently restricted to keywords. i'll probably end up doing somethign similar to rssjobs.com's copying of individual site's search form. i've avoided that before now because it adds another step at which a site can break the feeds with a minor interface change.</p><br><p>in other job feed news, <a href="http://dijest.com/aka/2003/08/05.html#a2525">phil wolff interviewed steve rose</a>, who runs rssjobs.com. if anyone had interviewed me, i would have given many similar answers.</p>
