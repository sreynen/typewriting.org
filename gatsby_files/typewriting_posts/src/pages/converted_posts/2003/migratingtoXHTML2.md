meanwhile, back in never-never land, <a href="http://w3future.com/weblog/2003/01/16.xml#a154">sjoerd visscher has migrated his (appropriately titled) w3future.com site to <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> 2</a>. he says <q>Things will probably get buggy for some weeks. It'll be interesting to see how this turns out.</q> in chimera on mac os x, i'm getting all the content from his pages, but the style sheets aren't loading, so it's just a stream of text. but it's an *interesting* stream of text. i think i'll wait at least until <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> 2 is a recommendation before migrating.
