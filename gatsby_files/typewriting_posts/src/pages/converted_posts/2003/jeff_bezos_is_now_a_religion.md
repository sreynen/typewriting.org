title: "jeff bezos is now a religion" 
---
<p>i was just browsing different meetup topics and noticed that in the middle of <a href="http://www.meetup.com/browse/rel/">more conventional religions</a> in the "religion" category is a new one: "jeff bezos". for those who don't know, jeff bezos is the founder and CEO of amazon.com. and now apartently there is a religion dedicated to him. this wouldn't surprise me so much if there were also a "bill gates" or "steve jobs" listing in this category, but jeff bezos currently stands alone as the only technologist who has spawned a religion on meetup.</p>
