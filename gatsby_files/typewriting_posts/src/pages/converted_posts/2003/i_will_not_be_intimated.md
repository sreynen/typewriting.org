<p><a href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/m/marktwain108638.html">mark twain</a> wrote <q>The difference between the right word and the almost right word is the difference between lightning and a lightning bug.</q> <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=intimated">intimated means</a> "made known subtly and indirectly; hinted". this definition is quite different from that of intimidated. <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=intimidated">intimidated means</a> "made timid; filled with fear".</p><br><p>i mention all of this because today i noticed a <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3186074.stm">BBC article</a>, which began (and until they correct it, will still begin) <q>The top US official in Baghdad has said the US-led coalition and the Iraqi people will not be intimated by Sunday's suicide bomb attack</q>. i assume paul bremer did not intend to suggest that the "coalition" and the iraqi people will not be made known subtly and indirectly. this was a mistaken word choice.</p><br><p>i wanted to see how far this mistake had spread (because often the same story gets published all over with different headlines), so i <a href="http://news.google.com/news?q=intimated">searched google news for "intimated"</a>. the mistake in this particular story hadn't spread beyond the BBC, but four of the top ten news stories using the word "intimated" use it incorrectly, with the intended meaning of "intimidated". the misuse was so common, i had to check the dictionary again to reassure myself that the two words don't mean the same thing. they don't mean the same thing at all. bombs intimidate. bombs do not intimate. certainly they have proofreaders at these newspapers. do they not know what these words mean?</p>
