<p><a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2003/07/21#quoteOfTheDay">doc searls</a> quotes:<q>The basis of ethics is man's right to play the games of his choice. I will not trample on your toys and you will not trample on mine; I won't spit on your idol and you will not spit on mine.</q> that's only the basis of an ethics of independence. you could just as reasonably suggest that the basis of ethics is man(people)'s obligation to protect other people. i will not protect you from my toys and you will protect me from yours. i will pacify my idol and you wil pacify yours. this is the basis of an ethics of interdependence. these two frequently come into conflict (humanitarian intervention or imperialist occupation?), which leaves us without a clear general rule upon which we can make ethical decisions. there is no external basis for ethics.</p>
