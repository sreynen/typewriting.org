<p>on <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/wire/US/ap20030205_2618.html">abc news</a>: <q>A congressman who heads a homeland security subcommittee said on a radio call-in program that he agreed with the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.</q> this could perhaps be spun as some sort of misunderstanding if he hadn't said <q>some of these Arab-Americans are probably intent on doing harm to us</q>. if coble's "us" doesn't include arab-americans (or japanese-americans), who does it include? it's offensive enough that americans of any non-european decent can be so thoughtlessly excluded from "national security" interests, but it's doubly outrageous coming from the chairman of the judiciary subcommittee on homeland security. why not just rename it the "subcommittee on white people's security"?</p>
