<p>i have used <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/camino/">camino</a> for too long. so long that i know what to do when it crashes, which is to delete the cache folder - without opening it mind you, as doing so would crash the finder - or else it will never open again. so i'm switching to <a href="http://www.apple.com/safari/">safari</a>, which i will also unhappily use and have been avoiding, mostly because of the metal theme, which i find ugly. i'm also starting to use <a href="">ichat</a>, having previously used <a href="http://www.indigofield.com/">proteus</a>. proteus allows me to use aol, yahoo, and msn instant messaging simultaneously, so that aol isn't the only means of messaging me (though 90% of my messages come through aol anyway - it's the principle). i started using ichat because proteus doesn't handle group chats correctly (by which i mean at all), but i will continue to use it because the interface is too slick to pass up. but i won't be happy about the lack of support for other IM services, nor the metal theme, though it's not as annoying in ichat because there's less window border.</p><br><p>i really have nothing to complain about. i only notice these unfortunate choices between the lesser of inconveniences because the rest of the software i use generally does everything i want with clean interfaces and no crashing. and these problems i have are with software for which i've paid nothing. these are my <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/resource/browse/0,cat,1223,sortIdx,1,00.asp">worst computer problems</a>. life is good.</p>
