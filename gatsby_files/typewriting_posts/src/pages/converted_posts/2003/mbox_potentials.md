<p>i was excited yesterday to discover a mailing list archive was available as an <a href="http://www.qmail.org/qmail-manual-html/man5/mbox.html">mbox</a> file, which i could just import into my mail client and read as if someone had emailed me the entire archive. this got me thinking about other potential uses of mbox. as an experiment, i plan to make my weblog available in mbox format. right now, it can be downloaded and imported by anyone with an mbox-compatible email reader. but all it would take is the ability to load web-based mbox files to turn an email client into a news reader.</p>
