<p>in <a href="http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/nation/1750749">this houston cronicle article on using nuclear weapons to prevent iraq from developing nuclear weapons</a> (ha! stop, you're killing me): <q>A White House spokesman declined comment Friday on Arkin's report, except to say that "the United States reserves the right to defend itself and its allies by *whatever means necessary*."</q> (emphasis added) clearly malcolm x is the inspiration behind white house policy. it all makes so much more sense now.</p>
