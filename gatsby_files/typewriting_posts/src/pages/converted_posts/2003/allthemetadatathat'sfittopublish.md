the "RSS w/ RDF" feed option in the <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/jobfeeds.php">job feeds</a> is no longer marked as "experimental". i've extracted all the metadata i can from both hotjobs.com and monster.com. in the process, i discovered that my scraper had been missing those jobs on monster.com with extra paid emphasis. how's that for irony? yet another reason monster.com should be providing their own feeds.<br>the next step is to look more at <a href="http://xmlresume.sourceforge.net/">XML resumes</a> and see how i can integrate that with RSS/RDF job feeds. my new end goal has moved beyond simply targeting job feeds to resumes. i also want to play around with a system of manufacturing job-specific cover letters, to be automatically emailed with a resume. it may not get anyone a job, but it will be interesting.
