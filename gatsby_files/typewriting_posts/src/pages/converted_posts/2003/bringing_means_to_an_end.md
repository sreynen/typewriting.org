<p>sadly, both the ACLU and the kucinich campaign support causes i believe in, yet both have mistreated me enough that i can't bring myself to continue supporting either.</p><br><p>you may recall that <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2002-12-21&amp;title=i+joined+the+ACLU+today">last year i joined the ACLU</a>, and then later <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2003-08-19&amp;title=nonprofit+junk+mail">i complained that i was getting junk mail from non-profit organizations</a>. it turns out the <a href="http://www.nettle.com/archives/000059.html">ACLU was responsible for that junk mail, as brian dear has discovered</a>.</p><br><p>in related news, i've withdrawn my support for dennis kucinich after the group of volunteers working on <a href="http://www.il4kucinich.org/">the illinois website</a> fell apart through internal disputes caused by a complete lack of direction from the campaign. if this problem were just in the website development group, i probably wouldn't be giving up on kucinich altogether, but the exact same problems exist with the whole illinois campaign. for example, there are two different email lists for the state campaign, representing two different management groups, each claiming to be the proper authority of the kucinich campaign. the whole thing is a massive failure.</p><br><p>i'll probably be supporting <a href="http://www.deanforamerica.com/">howard dean</a>, and trying to convince myself that <a href="http://www.deanforamerica.com/site/PageServer?pagename=InternetPrinciples">his understanding the internet</a> is more important than <a href="http://www.alternet.org/story.html?StoryID=16059">his driving an SUV</a>.</p>
