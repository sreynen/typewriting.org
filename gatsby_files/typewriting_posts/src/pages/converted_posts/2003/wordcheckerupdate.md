if you're one of the few people who downloaded the <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/software/cocoa/wordChecker/">wordchecker</a> source, you'll probably want to grab the new faster version. i finally got around to using the class in a real application only to discover it was far too slow. so now i've fixed that. if you're part of the slightly larger group of people who downloaded the sample application, don't bother downloading the new faster version. you won't notice the difference on individual searches.
