<p>thank you to my instant friend, <a href="http://annmariabell.com/">ann maria bell,</a> who pointed out to me that <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/jessica/index.php?date=2003-10-09#beetles+calling">the ladybug-esque creatures moving in with me</a> are asian lady beetles.</p><br><br><p>i failed to mention that these ladies greatly prefer our south windows, which are likely the warmest part of our building.</p><br><br><p>it sounds cute, but ann sent me some bad news and some worse news. the bad news: <a href="http://annmariabell.com/alternate/blog/blog.html#20.09.03:">they bite.</a> the worse news: i was wrong about the frost displacing them. <a href="http://ohioline.osu.edu/hse-fact/1030.html">they're staying the winter.</a></p><br><br><p>i'll complain, but i won't try to poison them.  that would be a hopeless battle with too great a cost, as ecologists have known since before they were called ecologists, <a href="http://www.time.com/time/time100/scientist/profile/carson.html">rachel carson</a> being one whose work i recommend.</p><br><br><p>so, if you're feeling overrun by asian lady beetles or any other pest, think about <a href="http://birds.cornell.edu/publications/birdscope/Summer2001/pesticides.html"><br>what you're poisoning </a> before you take action.</p>
