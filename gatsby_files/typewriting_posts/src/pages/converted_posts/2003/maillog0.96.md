<p>i know <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2003-07-26&amp;title=ten+random+feeds">i said the next version of mail log would have OPML subscription options</a>, but i lied. i decided that's going to take long enough that i shouldn't wait to release the minor changes i've made since the previous version. <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/software/maillog/">mail log 0.96</a> fixes a minor problem with email addresses and fulfills teh only two feature requests i've had so far.</p>
