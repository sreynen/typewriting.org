<a href="http://dew.blogspot.com/">blogstop</a> is a nifty acronym game. i see two potential improvements: first, requiring meaningful links within the text would make it more interesting to read and more difficult to write. and having the server automatically add &lt;acronym&gt; tags around the words as the acronyms are created would make it more readable.
