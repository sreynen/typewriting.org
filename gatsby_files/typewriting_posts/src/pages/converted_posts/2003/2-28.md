<p>today (2/28) is a national holiday in taiwan (where i am). this is something i knew nothing about before i came here, so i thought i might use this opportunity to educate you, assuming you also know nothing about it. basically, on this day in 1947, the <abbr title="Kuomintang">KMT</abbr> government began a genocide of the taiwanese which resulted in the murder of somewhere between 10,000 and 30,000 people (by most estimates). you can read more about it at <a href="http://www.uta.edu/accounting/faculty/tsay/feb28hd.htm">The February 28 Holocaust</a> and <a href="http://www.taiwandc.org/228-intr.htm">Remembering 2-28</a>. or you can read a critique of 2/28 memorials:<a href="http://www.antiwar.com/chu/c022500.html">Taiwan Independence and the 2-28 Incident</a>.</p><br><p>(unfortunately, the critique is really of taiwan independence, and 2-28 is just used as an excuse to villify pro-independence politicians. i don't have much opinion on taiwan independence, but i don't care much for the opportunistic (ab)use of people's deaths to support political opinions of any sort.)</p><br><p>so anyway, as my (one) taiwanese friend was telling me about the history of 2/28, i began to wonder why the <abbr title="Kuomintang">KMT</abbr> was still a relatively well-supported political party in taiwan. he said every country has a dark past. i guess what the <abbr title="Kuomintang">KMT</abbr> did following 2/28 wasn't much different than <a href="http://students.washington.edu/right/11-13-01/parties.htm">the american democratic  party supporting slavery before the civil war</a>, and yet most african americans vote for that very part.</p><br><p>(don't get me wrong - i'm not advocating voting republican. but i am advocating third-party voting.)</p>
