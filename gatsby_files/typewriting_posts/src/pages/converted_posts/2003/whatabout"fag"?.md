title: "what about "fag"?"

on <a href="http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/fword1.html">the smoking gun</a>, a high school student defends a constitutional right to use the word "fuck" after calling his principle "a fucking fag". the motion to dismiss the case is seven pages long and provides an extensive history of the word "fuck". it's an interesting read, but why is there no mention of the word "fag". i think it's both more offensive and more threatening, given <a href="http://members.fortunecity.com/gaytimes/faggot.html">the history of the word "fag"</a>. is this kind of bigotry so accepted that the lawyer didn't even bother trying to defend it?
