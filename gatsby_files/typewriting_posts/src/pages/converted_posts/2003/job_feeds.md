<p>i added hotjobs.com support to what was <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2003-07-30&amp;title=monster+feed">formerly "monster feed"</a> and is now "<a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/jobfeeds.php">job feeds</a>". i also gave it better error reporting. obviously i didn't get a job yet.</p>
