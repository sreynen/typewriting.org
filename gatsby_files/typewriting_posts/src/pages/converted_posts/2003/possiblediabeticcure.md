<p>i'm generally skeptical of much of what's newly available for diabetic treatment, such as <a href="http://www.caller.com/ccct/local_news/article/0,1641,CCCT_811_2400875,00.html">implants</a> and <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3089974.stm">vaccines</a>. but <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3266987.stm">the bbc today reported the first news that excited me in this area: a possible cure for diabetes</a>.</p>
