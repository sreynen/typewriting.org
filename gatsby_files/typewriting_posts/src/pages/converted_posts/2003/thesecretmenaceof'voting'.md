after the made-for-tv movie series "news", i'm sure you're aware that there's a recall coming up in california. what you may not be aware of is that this recall is part of a vast conspiracy, often blamed on right-wing extremists, but with much more sinister roots.<br><a href="http://involve.progressivemajority.org/action/index.asp?step=2&amp;item=11167">the progressive majority</a> writes <q>right-wing interest groups are pushing to overturn the results of a free and fair election</q>. <a href="https://www.moveon.org/texasads/">moveon.org</a> suggested that the recall is part of a trend <q>undermining our democratic institutions</q>. <a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20030901&amp;s=schrag">the nation</a> called the recall <q>tragedy, farce and a lot more</q>. clearly something is going terribly wrong in california.<br>but what these organizations don't want you to know is that the california recall is only part of a much larger threat to our democracy, and the very organizations criticizing the recall are participating in this insidious practice, known as "voting". the practice of "voting" allows individual citizens to throw politicians out of office simply because they don't like them. this practice is responsible for the recall in california, and it will be part of a much larger scheme planned by extremists on both the right and left as soon as 2004.<br>i've managed to dig up some quotes hinting at this secret plot. the progressive majority published <a href="http://www.progressivemajority.org/news/">a document</a> stating <q>If we are serious about *getting rid of George W. Bush* in 17 months, then we have to make some decisions and some commitments.</q> (emphasis added) they're talking about getting rid of the president, an elected official, using the same means they've criticized in the california recall: "voting".<br><a href="http://www.thenation.com/doc.mhtml?i=20030901&amp;s=schell">the nation</a> wrote <q>changing hearts and minds can at times be as important as *changing the President*</q> (emphasis added) they're not only talking about getting rid of the leader of our country, but also about a related plot to perform forced organ transplants. all of this can be traced back to the practice of "voting".<br>moveon.org even went so far as to publish <a href="http://www.moveon.org/moveonbulletin/bulletin24.html">a document</a> titled <q>VOTING AND DEMOCRACY: THE CHALLENGES AHEAD</q> clearly this "voting" must be stopped before it "challenges" and destroys democracy. but is there any hope? <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/africa/08/24/rwanda.election.reut/index.html">cnn reports that "voting" has already spread as far away as rwanda</a>.<br>to stop the plague of "voting", we have to first understand how it began. this is the truly frightening part of my investigation. it seems that way back in 1870, our own government approved and even formalized "voting" in a secret document known only as the "<a href="http://www.ourdocuments.gov/content.php?page=transcript&amp;doc=44">15th Amendment</a>". perhaps we are indeed too late to stop the scourge of "voting". but we must try. the first step is clearly to stop the recall "vote" before any more elected officials are "voted" away. if we don't act now before it's too late, we may soon have no one left to abuse our trust in government.
