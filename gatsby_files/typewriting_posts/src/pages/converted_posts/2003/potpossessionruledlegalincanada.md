<p><a href="http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/front/RTGAM/20030103/wxpott0103/Front/homeBN/breakingnews">the globe</a> reports: <q>Possessing marijuana is no longer illegal for anyone in Canada, an Ontario judge ruled yesterday.</q> because pot is legal for medicinal use, making possession illegal disrupts legitimate medical practice. but apparently this doesn't make it legal to smoke for non-medicinal purposes. interesting how changing one law creates this kind of cascading effect. i have a question though: isn't morphine legal for medicinal use? does that mean it's now legal to possess morphine in canada?</p>
