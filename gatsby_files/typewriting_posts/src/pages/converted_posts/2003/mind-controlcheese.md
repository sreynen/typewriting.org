<p>tom coates has <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2003/08/on_the_existence_of_god.shtml">an interesting piece about his atheist views</a>. my favorite part is in the comments, where he defends his atheism against agnostics:</p><br><blockquote>I simply refuse to accept that there's anything distinct and different about "God" that makes it different at a conceptual level from Mind-Control Cheese from Denver - ie. it's basically ridiculous. I do not consider myself 'agnostic' about Mind-Control Cheese.</blockquote><br><p>personally, i don't think the existence of "god" is quite as ridiculous as mind-control cheese from denver, but i just love that last line: <q>I do not consider myself 'agnostic' about Mind-Control Cheese.</q>.</p>
