title: "a sitefinder mystery"

<p>because i had read several headlines stating that <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/ent-news/article.php/3087071">verisign had shut down sitefinder</a>, i was surprised when i went to <a href="http://puzzleblog.com/">http://puzzleblog.com/</a>, and was redirected to <a href="http://sitefinder.verisign.com/lpc?url=puzzleblog.com&amp;host=puzzleblog.com">sitefinder</a>. i haven't been able to find another domain (or even subdomain) that does this. and to further confuse me, a whois search reveals that the puzzleblog.com domain name isn't even registered with verisign. it's registered at <a href="https://www.pairnic.com/">pairNIC</a>. so when you do a domain name search for http://puzzleblog.com/, your search is sent to pairNIC's DNS servers, which are for some reason redirecting everything without a subdomain back to sitefinder. odd.</p>
