i haven't bought a cd for a few years now, mostly because i don't want to support the <abbr title="Recording Industry Association of America">RIAA</abbr>. the <abbr title="Recording Industry Association of America">RIAA</abbr> general hurts musicians and music enthusiasts to help record companies make more money. there are plenty of cds that aren't produced by the <abbr title="Recording Industry Association of America">RIAA</abbr>, but it has previously been such a hassle to figure out which ones that i just wrote off the whole medium altogether. but now <a href="http://www.magnetbox.com/riaa/">RIAA radar </a> makes it easy to boycott only <abbr title="Recording Industry Association of America">RIAA</abbr> music.
