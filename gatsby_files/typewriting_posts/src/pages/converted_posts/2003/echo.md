<p>i made a <a href="http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/EchoExample">suggestion regarding echo</a>. i'm just posting it here, because i'm not sure how anyone would notice it otherwise. i think feed-level information is similar enough to entry-level information that the feed information should be defined in an "entry" element, perhaps with a "default" attribute.</p>
