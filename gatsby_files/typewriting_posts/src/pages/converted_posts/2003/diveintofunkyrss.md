<p>the following will only be of interest to you if you read "dive into mark" with a news reader: a few weeks ago <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/07/01/leave_rss_alone.html">mark pilgrim announced he was supporting <abbr>RSS</abbr> as its creator has specified</a>, and getting rid of the "funky" elements of his feeds. everyone thought that was nice of him until he actually implemented it, at which point his feed became nearly useless. i put up with it for a few weeks and then it occured to me that i don't need to - i can syndicate mark's feed and make it "funky" again. after doing that locally, i thought someone else might like to use the service. i emailed mark yesterday and asked him if he'd mind. no response today. i'm assuming that's because he doesn't care and making it publicly available now. if you want a "funky" version of mark's feed, simply redirect your news reader to <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/diveintofunkyrss.php">dive into funky RSS</a>.</p>
