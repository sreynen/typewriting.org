<a href="http://www.kottke.org/03/01/030108why_are_safa.html">jason kottke wants safari to be further integrated with other internet applications</a>. judging by his mockups, he just doesn't like the abrupt transition between applications. putting other applications within the browser is just a step away from making the browser a full system user interface. but rather than importing application-handling functionality into a browser, why not pull some of the browser niceties back out into the system's interface? i don't mean actually tying the browser to the operating system, but just using the same interface elements that are popular in browsers within the operating system.
