the <a href="http://www.puffinroom.org/iraq/menu.html">shocked and awed</a> gallery contains pictures drawn by iraqi children depicting the american attack and occupation. some of the pictures are amazing. one titled "christian love" shows an airplane is attacking iraq with cross-shaped missiles. some are just odd. one has a tank flying an israeli flag, something which by news accounts never happened in iraq. it's definitely a gallery worth seeing.
