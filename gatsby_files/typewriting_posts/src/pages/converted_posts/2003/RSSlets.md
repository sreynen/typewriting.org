<a href="http://www.eightlinks.com/features/000666.html#000666">RSSlets</a> are single-purpose html-to-RSS page scrapers. if it takes off, it could spread RSS widely, and demand answers to the questions surrounding unauthorized RSS feeds. a huge amount of content on the web exists as lists (whether or not it's marked as such), and RSS clients offer better interfaces for viewing lists than web browsers. work like RSSlets suggests that when simple semantic markups exist, the tools will soon follow to translate non-semantic content into something semantic. if these tools survive the inevitable legal challenges, we'll have a smoother road map to <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/">the semantic web</a> than the w3c is currently offering.
