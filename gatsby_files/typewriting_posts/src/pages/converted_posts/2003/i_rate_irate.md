<p>i'm always looking for a simple way to distribute my own music. i make it available on filesharing networks as well as on <a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/">my music website</a>. but i don't think many people at all have heard it. enter <a href="http://irate.sourceforge.net/">irate</a>:</p><br><blockquote><p>iRATE radio is a collaborative filtering client/server mp3 player/downloader. The iRATE server has a large database of music.</p></blockquote><br><p>sounds like a nice alternative to piracy. unfortunately their <a href="http://irate.sourceforge.net/documentation.html">answer</a> to <q>If I like a band can I give them a tip?</q> is <q>No. Not through iRATE. Some cultures find the concept of tipping to be mildly offensive.</q> did someone write them and say "please don't implement tipping, as my culture finds it mildly offensive"? i highly doubt it. some cultures find music mildly offensive. that's no reason not to implement a feature your users and content suppliers want. there's also no automated method of submitting tracks. so for now i'll keep looking for that mythical music distribution system everyone keeps talking about - the one that will fairly compensate musicians while reducing prices for consumers by cutting out intermediaries.</p>
