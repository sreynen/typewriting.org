you may have noticed that after a flurry of posts related to the <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/jobfeeds.php">job feeds</a>, i stopped updating it. you may have assumed this was merely an extension of my regular pattern of switching projects every three days, but there you'd be wrong. what's really happened is that i've bought a new domain name, disemployed.com, and begun working with two of my friends to improve and expand job search tools. barring unforeseen circumstances, the existing job feeds here on randomchaos.com will remain unchanged, and a better and for-profit version of the same will appear soon at disemployed.com
