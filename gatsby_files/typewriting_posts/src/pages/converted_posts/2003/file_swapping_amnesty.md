<p>a little over a week ago, <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2003-08-26&amp;title=towel+amnesty+day">i linked to holiday inn's towel amnesty plan, and suggested the recording industry should do something similar with file-swappers</a>. now <a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&amp;storyID=3390770">they're doing just that</a>. it's not quite as customer-friendly as the holiday inn, but it's better than nothing.</p>
