<p><a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=christian">the word "christian" means many things</a>. one of those things is "christlike". there are two ways a "christian" can be like christ. the first is to take an honest look at the character of christ and to try to emulate that character. the second is to take that same universally admirable character and twist it to the point that it resembles oneself. in my experience, the overwhelmingly majority of christians choose the latter approach. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2003/01/28/opinion/28LOCO.html?ex=1044334800&amp;en=ac051daf06661d72&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND">joseph loconte</a> is a prime example of just such a christian. you'd have to be a real *christian* to believe that christ was pro-war. and when i say "christian", i mean <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=sophist">something else</a>.</p>
