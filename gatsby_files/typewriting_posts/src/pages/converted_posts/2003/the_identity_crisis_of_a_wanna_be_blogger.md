i'm reluctantly facing the possibility that the brickhouse gazette is not an online journal, (personal reflections put up to start a dialogue with others) but rather a newspaper than nobody reads (pretentious in style and pathetic in existence).  i don't want to change who i am.  can i change my writing style without compromising myself?
