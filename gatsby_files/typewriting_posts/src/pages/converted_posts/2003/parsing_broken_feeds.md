<p><a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=2603">brent simmons</a> writes about why he can't afford to not display broken feeds. this is a chicken and egg problem. feed producers don't have a real incentive to fix broken feeds until feed readers stop reading them, and feed readers don't have an incentive to do that until most feed producers are already producing valid feeds. but with a new format, we have an opportunity to stop this problem before it starts.</p><br><p>all we need is widespread agreement among feed reader vendors to refuse to parse broken feeds. to make that unlikely scenario more likely, the group working on the format should make it clear that they encourage ignoring broken feeds, and suggest some alternative behavior that would relieve the burden on developers that brent described, such as replacing a broken feed with a link to a fixed URL explaining to the user that the feed is broken and the producer should be contacted.</p>
