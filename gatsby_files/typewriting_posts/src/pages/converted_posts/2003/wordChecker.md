<a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/software/cocoa/wordChecker/">wordChecker</a> is my first open source cocoa class and application. i made the application just to test the class, which i'm using in another program i'm working on. but then i thought someone might find it useful. for example, you could download the official scrabble dictionary word list and use wordChecker to settle game disputes.
