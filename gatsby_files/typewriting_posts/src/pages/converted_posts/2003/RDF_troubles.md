<p>very few of the examples given in RDF tutorials pass <a href="http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/">the w3c's RDF validator</a>, which is the only RDF validator i've found. this is likely because the w3c has been deprecating <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-rdf-syntax-19990222/">it's own recommendation</a> in favor of working drafts, which it seems no one is keeping up with. the RDF i'm including in the <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/jobfeeds.php">job feeds</a> also doesn't validate. and the error messages aren't particularly useful. so i'm giving up on validation for now. i know it's valid XML, and it makes logical sense. if anyone wants to explain to me in english why it's not valid RDF, please leave a comment or email.</p>
