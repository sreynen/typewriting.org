if you <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh">search for "hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh"</a>, google will ask you if you didn't intend to search for "hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh" (via <a href="http://www.languagehat.com/archives/000964.php">language hat</a>, from <a href="http://www.cinderellabloggerfeller.blogspot.com/2003_11_02_cinderellabloggerfeller_archive.html#106830085199848654">cinderella bloggerfeller</a>). this raises the question of what makes google think 26 h's should be 25 h's. certainly that sort of spelling correction isn't entered by a human, but it can't be just pure numbers either, or <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=ostitch">ostitch</a>, with only 22 results, would have a spelling suggestion, and <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=disemployed">disemployed</a> with over 1,500 results, would not. further testing of the letter "h" shows that it's not only 26 h's that returns a spelling suggestion. according to google, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=hhhh">4 h's should be 3</a>, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=hhhhhhh">7 h's should be 8</a> (as should <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=hhhhhhhhh">9</a>), <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=hhhhhhhhhhhh">12 h's should be 11</a>, and so on, up to <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh">128 h's</a>, which is google's maximum allowed word length. clearly google has some minor tweeking to do. i, for one, will not be satisfied until i can search for 129 h's and have my spelling properly corrected to 128 h's.
