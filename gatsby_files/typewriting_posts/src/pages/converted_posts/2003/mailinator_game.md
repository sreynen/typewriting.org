<p><a href="http://www.mailinator.com/">mailinator</a> has interesting uses beyond spam reduction, although i do enjoy the "flicking a booger at spam" analogy. the creators have already recognized the potential as an anonymous meeting point, and <a href="http://www.vfid.com/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=2&amp;forum=2&amp;jump=1">added the capability to mask from addresses</a>. one could also use it to make a virtual treasure hunt. send an email to an address and then give people clues as to what the address is. then in the email you sent, point the players to the next secret address. for example: according to "they might be giants", how many dollars does a prosthetic forehead cost? an email from me is waiting at the mailinator address of the correct answer.</p>
