<p>i've added google ads to my <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/japanese.php">daily japanese lessons</a>. after this weblog, the lessons are the most popular content on the site. i find this surprising considering i haven't worked on it in about six months. the google ads are very well targeted, so it's as much a feature as an annoyance for users. and if i start making some money, i may resume work on the project.</p>
