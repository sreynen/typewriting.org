there's a new link on the main weblog page to the mbox version of the weblog, which you can download and read in your email application (assuming it supports mbox format, which basically everything but microsoft does). you can also change the url to the address of any other weblog feed and turn any feed into an mbox file. i was surprised how easily weblog content can function as email and the ability to click "reply" and fire off an email to a weblog author, or click "forward" and send a weblog entry to my friends has exciting potential. i hope others will toy around with mbox as a syndication format.
