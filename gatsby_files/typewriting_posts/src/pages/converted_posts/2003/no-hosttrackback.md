<p>i just sent my first <a href="http://www.hitormiss.org/projects/trackback/">trackback</a> ping. if you have a weblog and don't have trackback enabled (i know, i know, everyone should), you can still take advantage of trackback by sending pings to related content from <a href="http://brutalhugs.com/cgi-bin/tb/tb_nohost.cgi?__mode=send_form">a no-host trackback tool</a>.</p>
