<p>of everything i've ever heard on the radio, my absolute favorite listening was episode 188 of this american life. you can (and should) <a href="http://thislife.org/ra/188.ram">listen to it in realaudio format from their website</a>. <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/07/30.html#a761">jon udell is also a fan of this american life, and actually went to the trouble of creating an encapsulation file of a particular segment he wanted to talk about</a>. but i'm not quite as interested in the technology (or lack thereof) of realaudio, so i'll just take the easier path and let you know that my favorite part is about thirteen minutes and ten seconds into the stream. or, you can just <a href="http://www.xanga.com/item.aspx?user=Debbie3&amp;tab=weblogs&amp;uid=31552957">read a transcription of my favorite part on debbie3's weblog</a>.</p>
