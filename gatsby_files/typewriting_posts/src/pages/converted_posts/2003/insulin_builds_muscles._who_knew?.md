<p>in the sixteen or seventeen odd years i've been an insulin-dependent diabetic, i've been asked probably a dozen times or so "what would happen if i took your insulin?" my answer has always been something like "i don't know, but i suspect your body would compensate its natural insulin production so that there would be no noticable effects." but thanks to <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3123545.stm">an article i just read at the bbc</a>, i can now answer more accurately: "you'll get stronger."</p>
