<p>i have an apple powerbook g4. my cable broke at the base of the powerbook a few months after i bought it. since then, i've tried reattaching it different wayws with varied success. currently, i just manually press the bare wires to the disconnected base, which isn't as difficult as it probably sounds. i'll have a new cable waiting for me in a few weeks when i return to america.</p><br><p>i've always suspected this was a product flaw, but my girlfriend blamed me for putting too much strain on the cord. so i took great pleasure in discovering that i was right, according to <a href="http://www.macfixit.com/article.php?story=20030611075049775">this article on macfixit</a>. i can also add further weight to the <q>speculation that the higher voltage used in some countries may act as a catalyst for power adapters' demise</q>, because my adapter's demise occurred here in taiwan.</p>
