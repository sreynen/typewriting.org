title: "my distributed computational linguistics dream" 
---
one of the dozen or so projects i have in the back of my head is a distributed computational linguistics. i had a pretty solid idea of how i would implement this until earlier today. different grammatical structures (simple sentences, noun phrases, verb phrases, etc.) would be defined by components in OPML files. word-level objects would then need a seperate XML format, and could be easily distributed. simple interfaces for maintaining these XML files could be written, allowing anyone to participate in a widely distributed computational linguistics project. individuals might take charge of prepositions, intransitive verbs, etc. my knowledge of linguistics is quite limited, but i think i know enough to get this kind of system working well enough that it could produce interesting results. unfortunately, today i learned that <a href="http://pedantry.blogspot.com/2003_07_20_pedantry_archive.html#105916881448121437">there is no such thing as a noun phrase</a>, so now i need to relearn (or unlearn) a bit about linguistic theories before i can even think about the project. meanwhile, i continue to wonder: why is it that people who study language for a living can't explain language using common language?
