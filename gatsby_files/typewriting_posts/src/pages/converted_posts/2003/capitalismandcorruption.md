<p><a href="http://improbable.org/chris/index.php?ID=43">chris adams</a> writes <q>corruption is anathema to capitalism.</q> which capitalism is that? america's current economic corruptions reflect poorly on capitalism in the same way that totalitarianism under communist rule reflects poorly on communism. neither are prescribed by the economic system itself, but both are practical results. chris also writes <q>There aren't that many people who still think socialiam is viable</q> untrue. whether or not they are right, there are still roughly a billion people in china alone who find socialism to be viable (even if they don't recognize they are no longer practicing it).</p>
