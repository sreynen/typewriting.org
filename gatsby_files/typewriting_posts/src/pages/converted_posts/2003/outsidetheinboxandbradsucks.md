<a href="http://www.bradsucks.net/?nav=oti">outside the inbox</a><q>is a compilation of songs inspired by and titled after the subject lines of mass-email (spam)</q>. brought to us by "<a href="http://www.bradsucks.net/">brad sucks</a>", "a one man band with no fans". i've enjoyed the songs, the idea, the band name, the band's (clearly untrue) description, and brad's own music. it's all wonderful and free to download. go listen.
