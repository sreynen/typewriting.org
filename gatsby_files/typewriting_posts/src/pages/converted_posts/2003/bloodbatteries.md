although most people's first thought when they read about <a href="http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/03/1059849278131.html">the device for turning blood glucose into electricity</a> is of cyborgs, mine was that this technology is ideal for diabetics, who have trouble controlling blood glucose levels. insulin pumps already exist, but now an insulin pump could operate without batteries and activate only when needed (when there is too much glucose in blood). insulin pumps are probably the one device in which it would even make sense to use glucose as an energy source. in every other case i can think of, all available glucose is being used for more important tasks like operating vital organs.
