i don't want arnold schwarzenegger to be governor of california (because <a href="http://www.rsicopyright.com/ics/fulfillment/eprint.html?rep=202:4651&amp;icl=3.5555.697170-43635">he seems to have a history of abusing his power</a>), but i also don't want to support <a href="http://www.moveonpac.org/moveonpac/viewcandidates.phtml">moveon's campaign against him</a>, because they haven't provided me with enough information for me to know if i support what they'll say. i certainly don't support their <a href="http://moveon.org/pac/recall/">assertion</a> that the recall vote "is an attack on American democracy", and if that's going to be included in the anti-arnold ad, i don't want to support that. so instead i'm posting this to publicize that i don't like arnold.
