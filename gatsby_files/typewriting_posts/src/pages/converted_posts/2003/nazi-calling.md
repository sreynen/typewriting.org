i'm against war in iraq, i don't like bush, and i'm afraid it will take lifetimes (quite literally) to regain the freedoms we have given up to fight a "terror" scarcely discernable from our own actions. but even i find ridiculous any <a href="http://www.roanoke.com/roatimes/news/story142267.html">argument that revolves around comparing current america to nazi germany</a>, or inserting phrases such as <q>with automobiles burning oil stolen from dying Iraqi children</q>. i mean, *come on* - dying iraqi children do *not* have oil. there are plenty of people who are actually suffering and dying as a result of america's failed military-economic-political regime. such fantastic imagery does them no justice. and if this is my reaction, i can't even imagine what a bush supporter must think. the "left"'s reaction to bush has been so pathetic that <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/goldberg/goldberg010303.asp">conservative writers have nothing better to do than criticize movie critics</a>.
