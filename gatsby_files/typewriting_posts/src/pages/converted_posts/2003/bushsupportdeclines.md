<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A45480-2003Jul11.html?nav=hptop_tb">the washington post</a> noted that bush's approval rating is dropping as casualties in iraq rise. this trend seems to be restricted only to american casualties, or bush's approval rating would have dropped dramatically when america <a href="">killed of thousands of innocent iraqi civilians</a>. (what does that say about america's compassion?)<br>now here are some interesting numbers: <q>slightly more than half the country -- 52 percent -- believes there has been an "unacceptable" level of U.S. casualties in Iraq...Still, only 26 percent said there had been more casualties than they had expected.</q> assuming those unexpected casualties are among the unacceptabl casualties, that means that 26 percent of americans were *expecting unacceptable casualties in iraq*. most of that (24 of that 26 percent) can be assumed to be among the <a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/03/23/opinion/polls/main545568.shtml">24 percent who didn't support the war in iraq</a> before the casualties began to mount. but that leaves a few questions: if those 24 percent of americans were expecting unacceptable casualties, why weren't they doing more about it? and more importantly, who are those 2 percent of americans who simutaneously expected unacceptable casualties and supported the war? that's about six million people who supported a war they expected to be unacceptable.
