<p>do you remember what i wrote in december? didn't think so. lucky for you, i'm around to remind you of <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2002-12-05&amp;title=domains+after+death">my ponderings of the fate of domains after death</a>. and lucky for all of us (who own domains), there is now <a href="http://afterlife.org/">AfterLife.org</a>, <q>a not-for-profit organization whose mission is to archive Web sites after their authors die</q>. now at least the website-as-memorial option is feasible, if still somewhat vain (in most cases, anyway).</p>
