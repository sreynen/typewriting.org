<p>in my increasingly desperate attempt to make money doing <a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/">something</a> <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/software/maillog/">i</a> <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/source.php">enjoy</a>, i've added google ads to the weblog. the ads aren't as targeted as those on the <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/japanese.php">japanese lessons</a>, because the weblog itself isn't as targeted. but hopefully you'll find them useful enough to make up for the distraction from my infinitely more important words. if you really don't like the ads, simply <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/document.php?source=scott_reynen_resume">give me a job</a> and i'll remove them.</p>
