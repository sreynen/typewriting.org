just stumbled across <a href="http://www.ledger-enquirer.com/mld/observer/living/food/7016337.htm">this</a> and found it amusing:<br><blockquote><br>The judge said the evidence showed that Shizawa was mentally "off."<br>Shizawa's lawyer, Simon Robert Hiller, said his client was a law-abiding citizen.<br>"He was in love," he said.<br></blockquote>
