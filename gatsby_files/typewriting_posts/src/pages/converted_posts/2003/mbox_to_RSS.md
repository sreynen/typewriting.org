<p>some other people's previous thoughts about mbox and RSS: <a href="http://crazybob.org/roller/page/crazybob/20030113">crazy bob has already made an RSS to mbox convertor</a> in java. <a href="http://justlooking.recursion.org/2003/Mar/9">luke francl wants to go the other way</a> and <a href="http://www.plaidworks.com/chuqui/blog/000164.html">so does chuqui</a>, from mbox to RSS. also interesting potential that way. in fact, by combining the two, an email client could be used to read *and* write weblogs. the user could just write "draft" messages to something like "weblog@localhost" and an external application could scan the drafts.mbox file for anything going to that address, and convert the results into RSS. or heck, even HTML. and to go really crazy, an email client can save files in a directory structure, so there's no reason we couldn't build an application to convert email messages into a full website, which could be auto-synced via ftp, and edited by anyone via email. it would be almost like wiki, but with no editing or deleting capability after an initial post. maybe that would be a useful commenting system. a mbox-formatted weblog could have a comments email address, so when readers reply by email, their email goes straight back into the website. a lot more to think about and implement.</p>
