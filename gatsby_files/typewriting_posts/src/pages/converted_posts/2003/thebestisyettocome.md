<p>as i was reading this <a href="http://www.quotationspage.com/quotes.php3?author=Robertson+Davies">robert davies</a> quote: <q>The world is full of people whose notion of a satisfactory future is, in fact, a return to the idealised past</q>, <a href="http://www.wglt.org/">the local <abbr title="National Public Radio">NPR</abbr> station</a> played "<a href="http://www.lyricsxp.com/lyrics/t/the_best_is_yet_to_come_nancy_wilson.html">the best is yet to come</a>", and i couldn't help noticing the irony. i think this would be a great song for <a href="http://www.deanforamerica.com/">the dean campaign</a>. maybe change a few of the lines, but the general idea seems appropriate.</p>
