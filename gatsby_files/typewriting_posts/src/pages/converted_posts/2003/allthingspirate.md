<p>today is international "<a href="http://talklikeapirate.com/">talk like a pirate day</a>": a good day to <a href="http://www.fidius.org/quiz/pirate.php">learn your pirate name</a> and <a href="http://www.wordpirates.com/">fight against word piracy</a> (including, though ironically endorsing, that of the word "pirate" itself).</p><br><p>i have a rather simple way of distinguishing between people who carry swords, wear eye patches, have pet parrots, rape, pillage, and plunder, and get scurvy from people who make copies of artwork. the former i call "pirates", pronounced with a short "a", like "pi-rats". the latter i call "pirates", pronounced with a long "a", like "pi-rates". maybe this isn't enough distinction, as the two have next to nothing in common, but it works for me.</p><br><p>anywho, i hope you - or ye (i suppose i should make some attempt at getting in the spirit of things here) - have a happy pirate day whether you spend it drinking <a href="http://www.globalgourmet.com/food/foodscpe/resources/cocktails/grog.html">grog</a>, or <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=501&amp;u=/ap/20030909/ap_on_en_mu/downloading_music_11&amp;printer=1">getting sued by the RIAA</a>.</p>
