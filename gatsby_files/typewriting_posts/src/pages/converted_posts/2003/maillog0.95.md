<p>i just uploaded <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/software/maillog/">mail log 0.95</a>. it's a vast improvement over mail log 0.9. i clearly have a lot to learn about version numbering. but now i think it's pretty close to 1.0. as always, <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/software/maillog/">download, use, and post comments</a>. oh yeah, and pay if you like.</p>
