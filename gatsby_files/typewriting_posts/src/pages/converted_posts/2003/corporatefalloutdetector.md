<p>my hat's off to james patten, who created the <a href="http://web.media.mit.edu/~jpatten/cfd/" title="corporate fallout detector">corporate fallout detector,</a> a tool much like an old-fashioned gieger counter that scans barcodes of individual products and then beeps according the amount of complaints about that corporation's ethics.  flip the switch to measure their reported environmental damage. its guys like patten who make me wish i invented cool stuff.</p>
