title: "kucinich is doing open source" 
---
<p>after volunteering to help with the <a href="http://www.kucinich.us/">kucinich campaign for president</a>, i've learned that his entire website is built with open source tools, with plans to release all new code under GPL. it's often hard to tell if a candidate really supports issues, or if they just adopt them to gain political support. if there was ever an indication of the a candidate's desire to do the right thing, i'd say this is it. it's not as if he could expect to get more votes this way. they aren't even publicizing it. they're just doing it because they think it's a good thing to do. that's so rare in politics, it's hard to believe.</p>
