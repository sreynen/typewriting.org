i'd like to see an instant messaging client that supports simple editing. the editing would be clearly marked as such, perhaps looking something like <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=2607">net news wire's new HTML differences view</a> (or, optionally, the user could enable unmarked editing). commands matching a defined editing syntax, maybe something simple like 'teh -> the' would cause the previously sent text to be edited accordingly. naturally, edit commands would just show up as text in clients not supporting editing, so the editing syntax would need to be human-readable.
