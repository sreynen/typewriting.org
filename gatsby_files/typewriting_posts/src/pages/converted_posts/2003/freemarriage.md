governments have no business having anything to do with marriage. if <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20030731/ap_on_go_pr_wh/bush_gay_marriage_30">american homophobia</a> hasn't made this obvious enough, <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20030731/ap_on_re_mi_ea/israel_mixed_couples_2">israel has just made it even more obvious</a>. but it should be common sense. marriage is a ritual acknowledgement of love. i can't think of anything more personal, and less appropriate for a government to be involved in. for further reading on how governments abuse control of marriage, check out <a href="http://usmarriagelaws.com/cgi-bin/search/usa.cgi">the marriage laws of countries around the world</a>.<br><b>UPDATE:</b> <a href="http://www.hrc.org/millionformarriage/index.asp">take action to help free marriage</a>.
