<p>honestly, i expected <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2003-07-26&amp;title=ten+random+feeds">the random feeds</a> to be of higher quality. too many bloggers are just pointing to the same stories with no commentary. why bother? or keeping personal diaries. why publish? it wasn't until today, after reading through forty or fifty feeds, that i found one i'm interested in reading further, ironically titled: <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0107343/">the blathering idiot</a>.</p>
