title: "i think the war is bad"

just in case anyone is reading this who is unclear about my views on the war in iraq, i think the war is bad. i'm unconvinced that iraq poses an urgent threat. i think the war is a testament to a vast lack of creativity in american government and a civic laziness among american citizens.
