<p>i know i am an internet geek because the highlights of my day were registering a domain name, writing a <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/regexdebug.php">regular expression debugger</a>, and hooking up <a href="http://www.unpossible.com/blog/archives/000021.html">a script to notify me via AIM when someone reads a post on my weblog</a>. these are all neat, yet of questionable usefulness.</p>
