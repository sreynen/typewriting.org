title: "sometimes democracy isn't enough" 
---
<a href="http://www.actionforum.com/forum/index.html?forum_id=258">moveon.org, "democracy in action"</a>, has a plan to interview presidential candidates and then, through direct democracy (limited to members) choose one to support. i thought this was a nice implementation of "democracy in action" until i went to review the potential interview questions, and found 914 of them awaiting review, including some exact duplicates and many near duplicates. this is a prime example of a situation in which simply making a process "democratic" doesn't necessarily make it good. with no filtering, organizing, or editing being done to the potential questions, only the first few, which don't appear to be ordered (though perhaps they are by date), will even be read. the most important questions will almost certainly not be asked.<br>so what's a better system? i would probably go with a wiki, but that's probably a bit radical for moveon.org. so maybe a rating system in which the lowest-scoring posts are removed. or one in which similar posts can be grouped and ranked against each other. there are several ways to sift the best questions out of the hundreds, but moveon isn't using any of them. it's sad to see poor planning preventing good intentions from producing results.
