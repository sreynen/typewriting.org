<p>as i happened upon a few links to <a href="http://news.com.com/">news.com</a>, i thought to myself "what a great domain name". news.com could easily compete with <a href="http://news.google.com/">google news</a>, even with poorer service, just because the address is so easy for users to remember - "you want news? go to news.com..." sadly, this domain name is largely wasted to promote the CNET brand. as if to formalize this brand-over-service strategy, CNET owns com.com, allowing it to redirect news.com to news.com.com. so news.com doesn't really exist in the sense that you can never load a page from the news.com domain. some day, domain names will fade away in favor of auto-generated site descriptions. maybe only then will CNET regret their failure to <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=capitalize#C0086500">capitalize (intransitively)</a> on the news.com name.</p>
