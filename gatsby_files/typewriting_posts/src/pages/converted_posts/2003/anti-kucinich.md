i've been wanting to put into clearer words my reasoning for <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2003-10-01&amp;title=bringing+means+to+an+end">ending my support for kucinich</a>, because i've found that i'm actually anti-kucinich now. i haven't talked about this with any of the few people i know who still support him, because i didn't really have an argument against him. it was just my own bad experiences, and a vague feeling i had this these experiences were a reflection of the campaign. i just found <a href="http://mailman.lbo-talk.org/pipermail/lbo-talk/Week-of-Mon-20031110/027273.html">an argument</a> that puts my feelings in better words than i could:<br><blockquote>If running for the presidency was a left-wing essay contest, then we would all vote for Kucinich.  It isn't.  Presumably Kucinich has heard of the Internet.  Where was his Internet campaign?  Where, indeed, is the Kucinich organization at all?  Does Kucinich believe that there is some invisible, natural majority for his ideas that will simply appear like genies when he says his magic words? Kucinich is running a vanity campaign, pure and simple.</blockquote><br>that's precisely what i feel it is too: a vanity campaign. what bothers me so much is that it's at the expense of people who are spending their time and energy supporting him. it's one thing for him to <a href="http://www.kucinich.us/walkfordennis/walkfordennis.php">talk about peace</a>, but the kucinich campaign was in practice by far the worst internal bickering i've ever experienced, and i saw no sign (and have still seen <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/IL4Kucinich/">no</a> <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Illinois4Kucinich/">sign</a>) that anyone at the national campaign cared. so i'm anti-kucinich. i not only no longer support his campaign; i oppose it.
