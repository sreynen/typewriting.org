i'm not a big fan of <a href="http://www.peta.org/"><abbr title="People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals">PETA</abbr></a>. for starters, <abbr title="People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals">PETA</abbr> seems to have decided long ago that the best way to bring about more ethical treatment of animals is by convincing everyone that animals are people too. and while i acknowledge that there are a frightening number of ways in which animals are routinely abused and i don't like it, i just don't believe that animals are the same as people. on top of that, i sent <abbr title="People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals">PETA</abbr> my personal information in exchange (i thought) for a free vegetarian cookbook, and i never got it. and i (though i realize unjustly) blame them for that.<br>so it is not my love of <abbr title="People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals">PETA</abbr> that is stopping me from joining the <a href="http://www.yourish.com/archives/2003/feb23-mar1_2003.html#2003030102">international eat an animal for PETA day campaign</a>. it's just that i'm vegetarian. but on march 15th, i will maintain my vegetarian diet with a special contempt for <abbr title="People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals">PETA</abbr>. maybe i'll even make a point to tell people that i became vegetarian before i even knew <abbr title="People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals">PETA</abbr> existed. that'll show 'em.
