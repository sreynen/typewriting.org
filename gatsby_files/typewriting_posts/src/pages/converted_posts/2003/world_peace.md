<p><q>So TIME asks you: which country poses the greatest danger to world peace in 2003?</q> only after <a href="http://www.time.com/time/europe/gdml/peace2003.html">voting</a> do you see the results. when i voted, the <abbr title="United States">US</abbr> had a lead with 81.8% of all votes. (iraq was second with 9.8%.) unfortunately, it's not even close to a good polling system, so there's really no conclusions to be drawn. but it's still interesting.</p>
