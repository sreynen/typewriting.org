<p><a href="http://www.ozzie.net/blog/2003/07/20.html#a101">ray ozzie</a> asks: <q>Has anyone yet attempted to create "RSS email"</q>. yes, my <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/software/maillog/">mail log application (for OS X)</a> originally allowed migration between RSS and email in both directions. but because the interface was too complicated, i redid it and in the process cut it down to RSS to email only. you can still download the 0.9 version, if you desire that functionality, and a future version will allow email to RSS publishing with a simpler interface.</p>
