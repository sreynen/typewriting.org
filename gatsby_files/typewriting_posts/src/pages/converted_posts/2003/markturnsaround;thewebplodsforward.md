<p>normally, mark pilgrim's "further reading" section is full of comments like "wow, mark is so insightful" or "what a clever trick mark came up with" or "i was going to do something, but mark did it first". <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/01/14.html#eddies_in_the_spacetime_continuum">today</a>, however, the comments are generally mocking mark's choice to "migrate" (seek asylum?) to <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> 4. for example: <q>And Let's hope he doesn't mind if we don't choose to follow in his golden 'well-linked' footsteps</q>, <q>Will Mark turn to ASCII?</q>, <q>HTML 1.0?</q>, and <q>I don't see the issue.</q> I also don't see the issue.</p><br><p>this is the first time i've ever linked to anything mark has written and disagreed with it. if i were alone in my disagreement, i'd probably keep reading until i could discover why mark is right and i'm wrong. but i haven't found one person who can offer anything more sympathetic than "it's okay to give up; markup is hard." but markup has always been hard. <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr> 2 doesn't even exist yet. mark writes <q>Now that I?ve had a taste of what it?s allegedly a stepping stone towards, I just can?t see the point.</q> but <abbr title="Hypertext Markup Language">HTML</abbr> was a stepping stone towards <abbr title="Extensible Hypertext Markup Language">XHTML</abbr>. so what's the point of going backwards?</p>
