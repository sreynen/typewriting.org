<a href="http://www.nypost.com/news/regionalnews/1711.htm">the new york post</a> reports: <q>The city is opening a full-fledged high school for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender students - the first of its kind in the nation</q>. this is segregation. it's likely segregation that the concerned parties are happy with, but that's precisely the problem. removing <abbr title="gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender">glbt</abbr> students from the rest of society will hinder the ability of everyone to solve problems of homophobia. it will be easier for "straight" teens to develop ignorant beliefs because they won't be exposed to <abbr title="gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender">glbt</abbr> youth, and the <abbr title="gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender">glbt</abbr> students will develop a false sense of security. and what about closeted students, who are stuck at the "straight schools"? with no exposure to publicly <abbr title="gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender">glbt</abbr> peers, how will they ever come out themselves?<br>also, this assumes homophobia doesn't exist among <abbr title="gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender">glbt</abbr> youth, which simply isn't true. anti-gay prejudices also exist within <abbr title="gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender">glbt</abbr> people, so moving them to a different school isn't going to remove the prejudices. it's nice that someone is trying to do something about these issues, but segregation is not the answer. why not put this money into improving the atmospheres of already existing schools?
