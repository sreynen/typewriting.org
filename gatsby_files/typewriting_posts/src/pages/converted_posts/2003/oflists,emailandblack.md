if a domain is on your blacklist, no email list in your domain should be allowed to send an email to that domain. otherwise, one will find oneself in the situation i am currently in. i am subscribed to mailing lists that i can't unsubscribe from because the mailserver i need to send an unsubscribe request to won't accept my email. but that doesn't stop them from sending me email. and lots of it...every day....<br>my situation isn't actually that bad because i can send my unsubscribe request through my webmail interface, and bypass my <abbr title="Internet Service Provider">ISP</abbr>'s (apparently) blacklisted mail server. but my ability to work around it doesn't make it any less of a problem.
