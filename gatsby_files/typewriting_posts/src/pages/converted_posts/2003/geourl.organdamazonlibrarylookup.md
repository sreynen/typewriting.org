<p><a href="http://geourl.org/">geourl.org</a> is just getting started, the author (joshua schachter) is interested in connecting with bloggers, and the site has all the data necessary to provide a "libraries close to you" service to tie into <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/stories/2002/12/11/librarylookup.html">jon udell's library lookup</a>. if i were jon, i'd email joshua and inquire about his interest in doing so. (and if i were joshua, i'd say "sure", but since i'm neither i'm just making a suggestion.) it would stimulate interest for joshua's project, and make jon's project more user-friendly. *<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=synergy">synergy</a>*.</p>
