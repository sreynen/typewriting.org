in the interest of ending <a href="http://intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/NameFinalVote">the name election of 2003</a>, i spent about thirty minutes looking for a name that the everyone can't help but to agree is clearly the best name for this project. failing that, i came up with "<a href="http://intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/KokoNameDiscuss">koko</a>".<br>in japanese, "koko" means "individual", "separate", "one by one", "every house", and "here". most of these meanings, i think, vaguely suggest the functionality of syndication (especially "one by one").<br>among english speakers "koko" is most commonly associated with a gorilla famous for speaking sign language. i like the association with communication.<br>on the domain name front, <a href="http://www.koko.org/">koko.com</a> is a radio station company in england, <a href="http://www.koko.org/">koko.org</a> is a nonprofit dedicated to the gorilla, and <a href="http://www.koko.net/">koko.net</a> is available (via resale).<br>potential trademark issue: <a href="http://www.kokointeractive.com/">koko interactive</a>, who abreviate their own name to "koko", is a company that <q>specializes in technologies that enable you to foster collaboration</q>. the closest match at the uspto is <a href="http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=60p38u.2.24">a patent for computerized medical equipment</a>.<br>i've now spent more time writing a pitch than i did searching for a name, completing my one hour of contribution to this project. hope it helps.
