<p>i'm <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/document.php?source=nanowrimo">collecting the daily outputs</a> of the <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/language/prose.php">prose page</a>. so far, according to <a href="http://javascriptkit.com/script/script2/countwords.shtml">a handy online word counter</a>, i have 2,062 of the 50,000 words i need to constitute a novel before the end of the month, putting me terribly behind schedule. but that's okay.</p><br><p>the prose page is entirely driven by google results. when i wanted to know how many words i would need to produce in a day to reach 50,000 in a month, i used google to do math for me. and when i wanted to get a word count, i again used google to find a page that would do that for me. there was a time when i would have launched applications to handle all of those tasks, but now i do them all in my browser, and i don't see any indication that this trend will change any time soon. increasingly, the web is my operating system, and google is my <a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/finder/">finder</a>.</p>
