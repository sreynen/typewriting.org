<p>unpacked boxes and piles of books block the path around our apartment and occupy every available chair. obviously, <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/document.php?source=scott_reynen">scott</a> and i aren't ready for visitors, but this hasn't deterred the scores of <a href="http://www.ent.iastate.edu/imagegallery/lady/">ladybugs</a> that eagerly clamor at our windows. they even creep inside in apparent eagerness to welcome us, the new tenants, into this old house in <a href="http://www.cityhall.ci.bloomington.il.us/historic/franklin.htm">this old neighborhood.</a></p><br><p>i think they're ladybugs. i've been told, because they're orange, that they are <a href="http://www.uky.edu/Agriculture/Entomology/entfacts/trees/ef409.htm">japanese beetles.</a> but they just don't look like the pictures i've found of japanese (scarab) beetles.</p><br><p>whatever they are, they don't mind our sparse furniture or clutter. they don't even mind us. why should they? beetles have helped themselves in every autumn and will do so regardless of their human roommates.</p><br><p>it's probably a beautiful metaphor of nature's faithful attempts to perservere through every trial. maybe i'll come back to that when they're gone, but right now i can't say i'll miss them when frost spreads across our windowsill in their place.</p>
