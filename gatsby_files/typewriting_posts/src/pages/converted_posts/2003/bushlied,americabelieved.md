apparently <a href="http://www.philly.com/mld/inquirer/news/front/6085261.htm">roughly a third of americans believe america found weapons of mass destruction in iraq</a>. this is an accomplishment in ignorance above and beyond the belief that iraq was somehow responsible for september 11. the philidelphia inquirer asks <q>How could so many people be so wrong about information that has dominated news coverage for almost two years?</q> i can't search beyond one week ago in the inquirer's archives (lame), but if i could, i'd look at what their headlines were saying seven months ago while bush was declaring that iraq had weapons of mass destruction. i don't remember seeing any headlines along the lines of "bush makes wild unsupported claims about iraq" or "is bush lying?". when the president says things, and the media simply repeats what he said with no scepticism, people believe the president. and even if the media is really just the government puppet it appears to be, people still believe that if bush had lied, he would be <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/news/archive/2003/06/17/national1755EDT0707.DTL">facing some hard questions in congress</a> now. after all, that's what happened to clinton, and <a href="http://www.iraqbodycount.net/">5563 people dead</a> is more important than an affair, right? .... right? we'll see.
