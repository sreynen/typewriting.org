i'm running out of time to tinker with my <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/language/prose.php">prose page</a> before the <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">national novel writing month</a> begins. i thought this event would be a good chance to test out some computer-generated prose, because <q>It's all about quantity, not quality</q>. so i signed up a long time ago, but then i forgot about it. and now i'm not even sure i'll be able to generate 50,000 words in a month.<br>the problem is that i don't have a lot of opportunity to test what i'm doing because google only gives me 1000 queries a day, and when i run out, i have to wait until the next day to do more testing. and then i forget until a few days before the <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">national novel writing month</a> begins. it would be great if i could just have one testing day to do however many queries i needed. but i guess i'll have a whole year to tinker before next year's <a href="http://nanowrimo.org/">national novel writing month</a>.
