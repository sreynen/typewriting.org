title: "why not mbox?" 
---
many of the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/featureIdeas.php">upcoming features for NetNewsWire</a> already exist in most email applications. i think NetNewsWire is a great application, but increasingly often, the similarity between email clients and news readers makes me wonder whether they aren't fundamentally the same application. certainly <a href="http://www.osafoundation.org/Chandler_Compelling_Vision.htm">chandler</a> will take us in this direction when it comes of age. but we must wait for that. granted, it's not an ideal format, but mbox does 90% of what RSS does, with an already existing base of clients and servers. and it could easily be extended to do the other 10%. i could understand if mbox syndication was proposed and rejected back in the day, but i can't find any suggestion that anyone even considered mbox before RSS was developed. it looks a lot like reinventing the wheel.
