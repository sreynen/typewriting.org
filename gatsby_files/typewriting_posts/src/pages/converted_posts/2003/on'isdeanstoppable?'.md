<p>i have two comments on <a href="http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2003/12/05/dean/">"is dean stoppable?", at salon</a>: the first is that mario cuomo gave a quote that shows he has no regard for democracy when he said:</p><br><blockquote>'Because [Dean] has people excited. Because he has money. Because he has a lock in the polls in New Hampshire. Because he has two big unions, he has the kids, the Internet loves him, because he came out early against the war.' That's all fine. But should he win?</blockquote><br><p>i'm not sure what cuomo imagines would determine if someone *should* win, if not the kind of widespread support dean has, but i suspect it's the kind of top-down structure that has been failing the democratic party since bill clinton left office.</p><br><p>my second comment is what i suspect is the only winning strategy for a democrat running against dean: change your name to "anyone but bush". "anyone but bush" has more support than any current candidate. i hear more people say "i'll vote for anyone but bush" than "i'll vote for dean" or even "i'll vote for bush". even most of dean's supporters are really "anyone but bush" supporters. millions of americans support "anyone but bush". they've even set up <a href="http://anyonebutbush.org/">a campaign website for "anyone but bush"</a>. they just need a candidate to take the name.</p>
