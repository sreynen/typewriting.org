<p>having no previous knowledge of mike lea, i just read on <a href="http://joi.ito.com/archives/2003/08/27/may_you_rest_in_peace_mazeone.html">joi ito's weblog</a> that he killed himself on friday, and then followed the link to <a href="http://www.dash-dash.org/">his homepage</a>, which, in retrospect at least, could hardly be more indicative of his impending suicide. his weblog from two weeks ago, for example:</p><br><blockquote>holes and memories. i have a hole in one of my teeth. when i move my jaw in a certain way, or explore the hole with my tongue, i get shooting pains through my head. i have a hole in my life, sometimes I think my life is nothing but holes. Whenever I think about them, it sends shooting pains through my life, and I want to die. I can go to a dentist and he'll pull the tooth with the hole in it. The holes in my life are what my life is made of, they are my memories, and the only way to excise them is with a bullet. It seems like other people heal with time, forgive with time, change with time, forget with time. I don't. I seem to be stuck here with my holes, memories and holes.</blockquote><br><p>i don't really know what to add to that, except that i have the song, "<a href="http://www.bemydemon.org/songs/another.htm">another man's done gone</a>" running in my head.</p>
