<p>a few weeks ago a friend of mine told me about <a href="http://www.psychiatry.cam.ac.uk/isa/whatis.html">synaesthesia</a>, a rare condition <q>in which a stimulus received in one sensory modality gives rise to an experience in another</q>. althought it sounds like <a href="http://paranoia.lycaeum.org/stories/other/life/anti-drug-brainwashed.html">LSD </a> or <a href="http://www.dragonquestfrontiers.com/seer2.html">fiction</a>, there seems to be a good deal of evidence suggesting that some people can actually do things such as seeing sound or smelling light.</p><br><p>it was just today that i discovered that i am possibly one of these people. i have a very strong tendancy to sneeze when i'm going from an indoor to an outdoor environment. because i spend a good portion of my day in front of a computer, i've joked that i'm "allergic to outside". but after reading that <a href="http://www.madsci.org/posts/archives/aug97/865380242.Me.r.html">about 25% of people sneeze when exposed to sunlight</a>, i suspect that sunlight is actually the cause of my own sneezing. this also makes me wonder if there might be a relationship between sun sneezing and <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2003-02-28&amp;title=i%27m+an+anosmiac">anosmia</a>.</p><br><p>neither synaesthesia nor sun sneezing have been researched much at all, unfortunately. this kind of phenomenon is so contradictory to how we normally think of the physical world that i would think it has great potential to drastically improve our understanding of a wide variety of scientific issues.</p>
