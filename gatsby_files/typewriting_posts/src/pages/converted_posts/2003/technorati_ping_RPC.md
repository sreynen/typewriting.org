<p>nothing on the <a href="http://www.technorati.com/ping.html">technorati ping page</a> or <a href="http://developers.technorati.com/wiki/pingConfigurations">the technorati wiki</a> explains exactly what information needs to be send to technorati via XML-RPC. i'm assuming it's the same information weblogs.com and blo.gs use, so i added that to my <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/source.php?source=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.randomchaos.com%2Fadmin%2Fmakemefamous.inc">makemefamous script</a>. and with this post i'll see if that assumption is correct.</p>
