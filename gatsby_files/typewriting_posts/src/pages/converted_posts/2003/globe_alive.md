<p><a href="http://web-dawn.hypermart.net/">web dawn</a> is a new weblog about "the social marketplace", where i discoved that <a href="http://www.globealive.com/">globe alive</a> is a search engine that returns actual people interested in talking about topics. it's such a brilliantly simple concept. unfortunately, they require to you use yet another instand messaging client to participate. surely there's a better way. but i was pleasantly surprised to discover that they have a very small mac version of the client. so now i'm all signed up and excited to begin answering questions about what i know.</p>
