title: "now using bitpass" 
---
i've just completed the process of making <a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/">all my music</a> available for purchase via <a href="http://www.bitpass.com/">bitpass</a>. the implementation was incredibly easy, and staff member rachel has been more helpful than i could reasonably expect. the only reason i see for them retaining the "beta" label is that the instructions for selling content are still a bit confusing. but i spent more time uploading my full song files than i did setting up bitpass.<br>of course, the downside of using such a nice sales system is that future sales will increasingly be a reflection of how well my music is recieved. problems with <a href="http://www.paypal.com/">paypal</a> and <a href="https://www.cashets.com/">cashets</a> provided a handy excuse for why no one was buying my music. now if no one buys my songs, it will either be because they don't know about it, or they didn't like it enough to pay fifty cents. and both of those problems are mine to solve.
