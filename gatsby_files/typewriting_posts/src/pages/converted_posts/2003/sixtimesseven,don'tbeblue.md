<p>as <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/08/14/calculator">mark pilgrim has already pointed out, google's new calculator function is nifty</a>. as i was looking around for some more <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Easter_eggs_(computing)">easter eggs</a>, i searched for "six times seven don't be blue" to find that - shockingly - there are no results for that. am i the only person who had that rhyme drilled into my brain while learning mutliplication with flash cards? the whole rhyme is:</p><br><blockquote>six times seven<br/>don't be blue<br/>turn me over<br/>i'm forty-two</blockquote>
