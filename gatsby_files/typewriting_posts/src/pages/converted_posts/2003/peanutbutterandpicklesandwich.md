i don't remember who first introduced me to the peanut butter and pickle sandwich, but it has recently come to my attention that not everyone is aware of this tasty treat. in fact - believe it or not - some even react with disgust when the combination of peanut butter and pickles is mentioned. but the nay-sayers say no nay after trying it. although i found no recipe on <a href="http://www.recipezaar.com/">recipezaar</a>, an otherwise wonderful recipe site, i did find one on <a href="http://www.freerecipe.org/Main_Dish/Sandwiches_and_Spreads/Peanut_Butter/PeanutButt_gjhi.htm">freerecipe.org</a> that goes like this:<br><blockquote>1/2 cup peanut butter<br />1/2 cup chopped pickle<br />1/4 cup hot water<br /><br />Cream peanut butter and water together and add chopped pickle.</blockquote><br>now i've never used 1/4 cup of hot water, so my recipe is even more ridiculously simple:<br>1/2 cup peanut butter<br/>1/2 cup chopped pickle<br/><br/>Put on bread and enjoy.
