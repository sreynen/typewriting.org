<p>i've been spending a lot of time working on the <a href="http://www.il4kucinich.org/">illinois for kucinich website</a> lately. actually most of my time has been spent trying to get some idea of what the goals of the site are, but i'm now unsure there really are any goals, or ever will be, so i'm taking a break from that until they change their slogan from "most disorganized campaign ever" to "kucinich for president".</p><br><p>meanwhile, i'm back to working on <a href="http://www.disemployed.com/">disemployed</a>, which is humming along nicely. not a lot of users yet, but i added enough functionality today that i felt justified in adding links from the <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/jobfeeds.php">job feeds on this server</a>, so hopefully that will drive in some traffic and we can start building a community or users.</p><br><p>we're already the third <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=employer+review">google result for "employer review"</a>, which is something i'm rather surprised none of the major job search sites have offered yet. and, of course, we're the first <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=disemployed">google result for "disemployed"</a>. not surprising, given that google still thinks it's a typo. (it's <a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=disemployed">a real word</a>, i swear.)</p><br><p>the next result for "disemployed" on google is the <a href="http://www.verba.org/owa-v/verba_dba.verba_en.select_page?query_verba=disemploy">logos universal conjugator</a>, a nifty little language tool i'm happy to have stumbled upon. language tools are a topic i've returned to lately, with the encouragement of <a href="http://annmariabell.com/">ann marie bell</a>, my wonderful new <a href="http://annmariabell.com/alternate/blog/instantfriends.html">instant friend</a>, who i suggest you get to know yourself.</p><br><p>what i've been working on is <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/prose.php">a system of programmatically creating new sentences by combining overlapping sentence fragments from existing sentences</a>. it runs on the google api, so it's limited to 100 ten-word sentences a day currently. eventually, i'll save the sentences, so it doesn't just time out when it runs out (so don't reload too many times, or you'll be hogging all the fun).</p><br><p>and if all that weren't enough to back up <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2003-09-04&amp;title=because+i+have+ample+free+time">my assertion that busy people don't write as much</a>, i'm in the middle of moving to a new state with <a href="http://talklikeapirate.com/howto.html">me beauty (don't forget it's talk like a pirate day)</a>. soon, i hope, <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2003/09/09/these_days">these will be those days</a>.</p>
