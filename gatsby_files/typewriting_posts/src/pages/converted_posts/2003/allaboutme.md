<p>i made myself <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/foaf.rdf">a <abbr title="Friend Of A Friend">FOAF</abbr> file</a>, complete with a myers-briggs personality descriptor, which i determined at <a href="http://www.humanmetrics.com/cgi-win/JTypes1.htm">human metrics</a>. i'm <abbr title="Introvert iNtuition Thinking Judging">INTJ</abbr>, which seems pretty accurate to me. and i'm not just saying that because <a href="http://keirsey.com/personality/ntij.html">keirsey.com</a> calls this "mastermind".</p>
