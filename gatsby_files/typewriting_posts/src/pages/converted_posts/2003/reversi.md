<p>i made an implementation of <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/games/reversi/">reversi</a>, the game also known as "othello". you can currently play against a local player (at the same computer as you), or play two different computer opponents. it's a work in progress, but it's far enough along already that you can use it. and if you're a web developer, you can peak at the source and see how easy it is to make your own reversi bot. i plan to soon implement bot-to-bot games, and remote games, as well as make some bot-writing documentation.</p>
