<p>In the interest of starting my ever-hypothetical band, I've been following the <a href="http://denver.craigslist.org/muc/">musician ads on Craigslist</a> since I arrived in Denver. And though I've only responded to one ad so far, and my band remains entirely hypothetical, I have noticed something interesting. At least once a day, two ads will appear one after the other, apparently seeking each other. I started taking screen shots a few days ago.</p><br><p>Bassist:</p><br><img src="http://typewriting.org/image/article/content/craigslist/2007-06-09-bassist.jpg" alt="Bassist available/sought" /><br><p>Drummer:</p><br><img src="http://typewriting.org/image/article/content/craigslist/2007-06-09-drummer.jpg" alt="Drummer available and sought" /><br><p>Drum *and* Bass:</p><br><img src="http://typewriting.org/image/article/content/craigslist/2007-06-10-drum_and_bass.jpg" alt="Drum and Bass available and sought" /><br><p>Lead guitarist:</p><br><img src="http://typewriting.org/image/article/content/craigslist/2007-06-10-guitarist.jpg" alt="Guitarist available and sought" /><br><p>Vocalist:</p><br><img src="http://typewriting.org/image/article/content/craigslist/2007-06-11-vocalist.jpg" alt="Vocalist available and sought" /><br><p>When I see these, I'm really tempted to respond to both ads, just to point them to one another. But maybe they find each other without my help. In any case, I now have a new strategy for forming a band. First, I will compose a compelling Craigslist ad titled "Singer-songwriter seeks cellist and drummer." Then, just before posting the ad, I will instead respond to the inevitable just-posted ad titled "Cellist and drummer seek singer-songwriter."</p><br>
