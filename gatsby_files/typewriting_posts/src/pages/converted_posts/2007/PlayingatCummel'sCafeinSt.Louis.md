<p class="vevent">My friend JJ is in a band called <a href="http://www.myspace.com/theodoreacoustic">Theodore</a>, which <a href="http://typewriting.org/2006/09/10/Buy_Me_an_Ounce/#content">I wrote about</a> back when they visited Iowa. They have <a href="http://collect.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=music.showDetails&amp;Band_Show_ID=10767007&amp;friendid=11684245" class="url">a show</a> in St. Louis next Friday at <abbr class="dtstart" title="20070209T1900-0600">7pm</abbr> (MySpace doesn't tell you the time for some reason), and I was thinking I might go to it now that I am living relatively near St. Louis.  But this morning JJ called and asked if I wanted to play at this show, and of course I said yes. So now *I* have a show in St. Louis next Friday at <abbr class="dtend" title="20070210T2200-0600">7pm</abbr>. It's at <span class="location vcard"><span class="fn org">Cummel's Cafe</span>,<br><span class="adr"><span class="street-address">1627 Washington St.</span> in <span class="locality">St. Louis</span>, <abbr class="region" title="Missouri">MO</abbr></span></span>, if you want to <span class="summary">come hear me</span>. There's a $5 door fee, but Theodore alone is well worth that, and I'm sure I add at least $1 in value, so you're really getting quite a deal.<br>This will be my first show in a city as large as St. Louis, and also my first show with a door fee, so both should be interesting new experiences. Between <a href="http://typewriting.org/2007/01/31/Time_is_Elastic/#content">working too much</a>, I have been redesigning <a href="http://music.typewriting.org/">the music portion of this site</a> to make it less a jumble of MP3s and more an *organized* jumble of MP3s. Hopefully I'll have that finished soon, and then I'll record a few songs I've been postponing until I'm done with the site revamp. Until then, you can probably hear most of my new songs at the show on Friday.
