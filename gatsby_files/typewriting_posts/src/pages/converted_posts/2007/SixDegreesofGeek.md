title: "Six Degrees of Geek" 
---
We start with Cory Doctorow. Cory is most famous among geeks for writing on <a href="http://boingboing.net/">Boing Boing</a>, one of the most popular blogs. If you don't read Boing Boing, and have no idea what a "blog" is, that's okay. I'm su'll find your opportunity to jump on the geek-mobile later. From Cory we connect to Mark Frauenfelder, who also writes on Boing Boing, and is editor of <a href="http://www.makezine.com/">MAKE magazine</a>. In relation to MAKE, Mark was recently <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/motherload/?ml_video=83321">on The Colbert Report</a>, so from there we connect to Stephen Colbert. Stephen was previously on The Daily Show, of course. (Are you a geek yet?) Also on The Daily Show: super-geek John Hodgman. You may also know John from his role as "PC" in <a href="http://www.apple.com/getamac/ads/">Apple's recent ads</a>, or maybe from his recent geeky book, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Areas-My-Expertise-John-Hodgman/dp/0525949089">Areas of My Expertise</a>. In the audio version of the book, <a href="http://www.jonathancoulton.com/">Jonathan Coulton</a> appears. Jonathan writes geeky songs. Yesterday, Jonathan appeared <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/archives/2007/03/030808.html">on Ze Frank's The Show</a>. Ze Frank has a geeky video show.<br>Thus completes our six degrees of geek: Cory-Mark-Stephen-John-Jonathan-Ze. This is the geek train I ride on. Seeing Jonathan with Ze Frank today was the geek-fest that prompted me to write this. But now that I look at the list, I note that these are six white men of roughly the same age and economic background. And we can easily branch out in other directions of geekiness (e.g. Stephen Colbert vs. The Decemberists) and find more of the same. It's hard to dismiss as coincidence that I am a geek, and also a white male of roughly the same age and economic background. I'd never heard of any of these people as I was becoming a geek, so how did that happen?
