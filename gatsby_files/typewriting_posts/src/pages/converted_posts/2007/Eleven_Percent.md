<p>I'm often confused when I do some simple math on poll data. According to <a href="http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/06/07/ap3799353.html">this poll</a>, for example, <q>Only 32 percent said they were satisfied with how Bush is handling his job</q> and <q>only 21 percent said they believe things in the U.S. are heading in the right direction.</q> So 32 minus 21 &#8230; Does that mean 11 percent are satisfied with heading in the wrong direction? Is there an alternate reading of these numbers I'm missing? If not, what is *wrong* with those eleven percent?</p>
