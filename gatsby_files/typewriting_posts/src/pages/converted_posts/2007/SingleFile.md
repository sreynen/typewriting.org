<p>An amusing scene I witnessed earlier today: Two adults walk past on the sidewalk, single file. Possibly a mother and father. Or maybe two single parents. Two children walk behind, side by side. A girl and a boy.</p><br><p><i>Mother</i>: "Elliott, Sarah, let's walk single file so people can get by."</p><br><p><i>Elliott</i>: "We were."</p><br><p><i>Mother</i>: "That's not really&#8212; "</p><br><p><i>Elliott</i>: "Well *I* was."</p><br><p><i>Mother</i>: [Pauses to reflect on conversation.] "Do you know what single file means?"</p>
