<p>As I was attempting to buy gas last week, I was somewhat startled to read this error message:</p><br><img src="http://typewriting.org/image/article/content/invalid_loyalty.jpg" alt="Invalid Loyalty" /><br><p>You may recall a few years back, <a href="http://news.com.com/2100-1023-980889.html">the Defense Department had a Total Information Awareness</a> plan to data-mine credit cards for suspicious activity. And <a href="http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/2001/08/45798">the FBI had its own Carnivore program</a> to survey online activity. Put these two programs together, and the government could shut off my credit card after discovering I didn't support the war. INVALID LOYALTY.</p><br><p>Thankfully we're not there quite yet. I was using a gas station affiliated with the local grocery store, and apaprently I pressed the wrong button to indicate I wanted to use my discount card to get a discount on gas (in exchange, apparently, for my loyalty). So when prompted to scan my card, I scanned my credit card. And the result was this, I think, funny error message: INVALID LOYALTY.</p><br><p>I was in a bit of a hurry on my way out of town, but I thought it was worth repeating the process to get a picture of the gas machine apparently questioning my patriotism.</p>
