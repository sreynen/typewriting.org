<a href="http://playinghere.com/">Playing Here</a> is a website I've been working on in my spare time for a few months now. It's still a little rough around the edges but I discovered earlier today that <a href="http://search.yahoo.com/search?p=playinghere.com">Yahoo is returning the site in search results</a> (despite no links on the web yet), so I guess the cat's out of the bag. The focus of the site is local music listings, and the core functionality for that is available in four delicious flavors: HTML, email, JavaScript include, and feeds. Here's an example of a JavaScript include:<br><script type="text/javascript" src="http://playinghere.com/js/CO/Denver/"></script><br>I have a long list of planned improvements, but I'd love to get some feedback on the site so far.
