<blockquote><p>Frank is a photographer from New Orleans. He graduated from Tulane University with degrees in Cognitive Science and Philosophy. Frank found photography on a lake in Maine; he lost it in the bright lights and darkrooms of New York, and rediscovered it in the curving columns of Coliseum Street.<br /><br>Frank's photographs have won some awards and he hopes they will win some more, because people like awards.</p></blockquote><br><p>&#8212; <a href="http://www.frankrelle.com/index.cfm"><cite>Frank Relle</cite></a>. Via <a href="http://bookowl.blogspot.com/2006/06/little-art-little-soccer.html">Dan</a>. Interesting photography, but I've mostly quoted because I found the "about" humorous: <q>&#8230;because people like awards.</q> I was sitting in a bar last night watching <a href="http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/sports/baseball/mlb/oakland_athletics/14903839.htm">a White Sox game</a> in overtime, and thinking about how some people really care about local sports teams, and other people just become interested out of sympathy for the true believers. Some people really care about awards, and Frank Relle has sympathy for those true believers. Some times it's not enough to get your priorities in order, to stop caring about unimportant things. Sympathy is still important.</p>
