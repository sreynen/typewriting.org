<p>On the off chance that someone stumbled upon this unaware that Nov. 7, 2006 is an election day, it is. And you should vote. Unless you're not registered, in which case you should register. Unless you're not old enough to register, in which case you should look forward to growing older. Unless you're not American, in which case you should vote in your own country. Unless you don't have elections in your own country, in which case you should watch in bitter resentment as Americans take our democracy for granted.</p>
