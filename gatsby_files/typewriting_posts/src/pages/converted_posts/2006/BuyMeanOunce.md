<p>Buy Me an Ounce (<a href="http://music.typewriting.org/mp3s/scott_reynen/buy_me_an_ounce.mp3">MP3</a>, <a href="http://music.typewriting.org/lyrics/scott_reynen/buy_me_an_ounce">lyrics</a>) is my third song (<a href="http://typewriting.org/2003/12/16/anyone_lived_in_a_pretty_how_town/">one</a>, <a href="http://typewriting.org/2006/06/17/next_to_of_course_god_america_i/">two</a>) with lyrics from a poem by e. e. cummings. I believe the poem is something about gender inequality, but I'm not as clear on the meaning as I have been with the previous two. In other music news, a couple weeks ago I uploaded a song to MetaFilter music, <a href="http://music.metafilter.com/mefi/496">a cover of one of my favorite songs, XO by Elliott Smith</a>, which was requested by someone I only know as "cortex" on MetaFilter. I was pretty happy with how it turned out.</p><br><p>Last weekend I had the pleasure of hearing <a href="http://www.myspace.com/theodoreacoustic">Theodore</a> play twice. I went to hear them play Thursday night because my friend JJ is in the band, but I went to hear them again Friday night because I really like their music. Unfortunately their recordings are only available on MySpace, an awful website, and those recordings are all rather old and don't sound much like the current band. But if you get a chance to hear Theodore (from St. Louis), I recommend you take it. If I end up moving to Carbondale, I hope I might be able to perform with them. Meanwhile, I'm writing songs. I have two more on my to-record list.</p>
