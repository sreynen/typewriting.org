<p>So first the database locked up from too much activity, and then the web server itself died. Apologies to anyone else being hosted on the same machine. My brother <a href="http://sidewalktheory.com/">Kevin</a> (who doesn't update his website enough) kindly offered backup hosting, which will hopefully hold until I make a page to split up the traffic and/or the traffic dies down a bit.</p><br><p>It's been a crazy couple of days. And it's not over yet.</p>
