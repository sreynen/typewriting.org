<p>For anyone a bit confused about the difference between <a href="http://typewriting.org/2006/03/18/Reminder%3A_You_Will_Die/">concurrence</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypoglycemia#Determining_the_cause">causation</a>, I'm pleased to report that I took a bike ride this evening and did *not* almost die, reducing my near-death bike ride percentage to fifty for the year. I hope to have my N-DBRP (pronounced "nod burp") down to about two by fall, solidly debunking theories that bike rides significantly increase likelihood of death.</p>
