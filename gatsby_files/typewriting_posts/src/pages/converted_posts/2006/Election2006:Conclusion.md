A few people have commented to me that I'm putting a lot of work into my votes here. It probably shouldn't take this much work to vote thoughtfully, as candidates would ideally be forthcoming with clear positions on issues. But voting thoughtfully also shouldn't be exceptional enough that it's worth a comment. Unfortunately, voting itself is still exceptional in America.<br>In my fantasy America, election day is a national holiday during which we celebrate living democracy. Businesses would shut down and we'd have nothing better to do than to vote thoughtfully. We'd all have election day parties, at which showing up without an "I voted" sticker would be like showing up at a Halloween party without a costume, or showing up at a birthday party without a gift.<br>But until that happens, this is the democracy we have, and these are the ovals I filled in on my ballot. Now who are you voting for? And why?<br><div class="clear"></div>
