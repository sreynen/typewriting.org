title: "Release Later, Release Better"

<p>For a long time now, I've applied the "release early, release often" principle, only to have someone else "release later, release better."</p><br><ul><br><li>I made <a href="http://disemployed.com/">Disemployed</a>. Someone else made <a href="http://www.indeed.com/">Indeed</a>.</li><br><li>I made <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/rssfilter/">RSS Filter</a>. Someone else made <a href="http://feedrinse.com/">Feed Rinse</a>.</li><br><li>I made <a href="http://randomchaos.com/microformats/base/">Microformats Base</a>. Someone else made <a href="http://kitchen.technorati.com/search/">Microformats Search</a>.</li><br><li>I made interesting software. Someone else made money and recognition.</li><br></ul><br><p>Well I've finally learned my lesson and I'm done releasing early and often. From now on, I'm releasing later and better.</p>
