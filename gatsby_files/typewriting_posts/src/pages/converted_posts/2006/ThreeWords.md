Three Words (<a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/mp3s/scott_reynen/three_words.mp3">MP3</a>, <a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/lyrics/scott_reynen/three_words">lyrics</a>) is a new song, about language falling short. An interesting part of working in a buzzword-heavy industry is watching as words become meaningless, by "too many people, saying too much, saying nothing at all." The term "AJAX," for example, meant something more than "DHTML" for maybe a week before it was thrown carelessly into so many sentences that it lost all meaning in common use. I think the same thing happens with all words (<a href="http://typewriting.org/2006/05/10/QOTD%3A_Christianism/">e.g.</a>), though not often as quickly.
