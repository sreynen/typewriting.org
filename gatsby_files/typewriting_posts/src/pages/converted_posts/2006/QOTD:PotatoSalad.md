<blockquote><p>Actually, here is the analogy that came to me by way of good old Sesame Street. They once had a story about the King and the picnic, where the King kept telling everyone to bring the same item. After lots of samey instances where the entire kingdom brought potato salad (usually at the urging of the King, who said "you can't have a picnic without potato salad!"), the King learns how to delegate and a good time was had by all.</p><br><p>That, in a nutshell, is my problem with sweeping declarations like "markets are conversations" or "all marketers are liars" or "go Pinko". It's not a picnic without potato salad, but it's not a picnic with ONLY potato salad. </p><br></blockquote><br><p>&#8212; <cite><a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/2006/04/04/mix-and-match/#comment24354">Ethan, on Burningbird</a></cite></p><br><p>Mmm.... moderate amounts of potato salad. What a useful analogy.</p>
