The first out of contention is Mary J. Martin, running in the Socialist Workers Party. She's out because she has no website. There are some less important offices for which I'll let a candidate  get by without a website, but not Governor.</p><br><p>Next out is <a href="http://www.shrinkiowagov.org/governor.html">Kevin Litten</a>, running in the Libertarian Party. His poorly designed website is lacking any information on specific issues, perhaps because he's already given up, saying <q>I may not win this election.</q> Sorry Kevin, try a little harder next time. And then there were three.</p><br><p>I don't trust <a href="http://nussle.house.gov/">Jim Nussle</a>, the Republican candidate for Governor. Specifically I don't like his ambiguous position on abortion, which apparently <a href="http://www.hawkeyegop.com/2006/09/nussle_on_abort.html">bothers people on the other side of the issue as well</a>. I can understand the desire to ban all abortion. I think it's mistaken, but an honest mistake. But Jim Nussle seems to be hiding his real position, and that's why he lost my vote.</p><br><p>The remaining to candidates for Iowa Governor are <a href="http://www.chetculver.com/">Chet Culver</a>, on the Democratic Party ticket, and <a href="http://www.votewendy.org/">Wendy S. Barth</a>, on the Green Party ticket. Barth looks much better. She has clear positions on important issues, and in general I agree with those positions. Culver, on the other hand, takes vaguely agreeable positions on popular issues. If I was the only one voting in this election, I would have voted for Barth.</p><br><p>But I looked at the polls and saw that Culver and Nussle were in a statistical tie, so I filled in Culver's oval as a strategic vote against Nussle. Sorry Green Party. The day after I filled in this oval, a new poll came out with Culver ahead by 7%. In retrospect, I should have waited until closer to the election to fill in my ballot at all. But it's done now, and I voted for Culver for Governor.</p><br><div class="clear"></div>
