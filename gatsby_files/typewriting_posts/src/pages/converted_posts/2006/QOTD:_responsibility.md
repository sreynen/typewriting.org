<blockquote><p>Your car alarm is ridiculous. Years of trigger-happy alarms have trained the public to ignore them, and nobody would care if your tastelessly noisy car got stolen anyway. If someone had driven off in it last night as the alarm was blaring, I would have applauded him! THIS IS WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO MY SENSE OF CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY.</p></blockquote><br><p>&#8212; <a href="http://www.qwantz.com/index.pl?comic=752"><cite>Dinosaur Comics</cite></a></p>
