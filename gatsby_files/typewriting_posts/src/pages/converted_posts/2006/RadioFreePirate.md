A group of my friends from university have been sharing an email list for a few years now. We recently started <a href="http://radiofreepirate.org/blog/">a blog at radiofreepirate.org</a>. It's currently pseudonymous, which is new for me (though I suppose that's exactly what I'd say if it wasn't), and it's multi-author, which is also new to me. It's been interesting so far, but I'm not sure we've really determined what it is just yet.
