<blockquote><p>When you're a law student, they tell you if say that if you can't argue the law, argue the facts. They also tell you if you can't argue the facts, argue the law. If you can't argue either, apparently, the solution is to go on a public relations offensive and make it a political issue... to say over and over again "it's lawful", and to think that the American people will somehow come to believe this if we say it often enough.</p></blockquote><br><p>&#8212; <cite><a href="http://insomnia.livejournal.com/652389.html?nc=2&amp;style=mine">David Cole, Georgetown University Law Professor</a></cite></p>
