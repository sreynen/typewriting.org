I'll be playing at the Continental Lounge in Des Moines again this Wednesday, and then next Wednesday, and I suspect the Wednesday after that, but I didn't want to push my luck. The owner of the Continental Lounge seems to like my music, so I expect to play there regularly, until I move. Which brings me to the other news:<br>Jessica has a job that starts in a few weeks teaching at <a href="http://www.siuc.edu/">Southern Illinois University</a>. It's not all finalized yet, but it seems likely she'll be leaving for Carbondale in a couple weeks. "But Scott," you say, "SIU is in Carbondale, and your job is in Des Moines. How is that working?" It's not really. Not yet, anyway. For now, I'm staying here in Des Moines while Jessica starts work in Carbondale. Interesting honeymoon, I know, but I'm confident it will work out.<br>There's a small chance Jessica will still find a good <abbr title="English as a Second Language">ESL</abbr> teaching job in Des Moines, in which case I won't move to Carbondale at all. There's a slightly more likely scenario that I'll find a job in Carbondale in the next few months and move there then. But neither job market seems very good for our respective vocations right now, so the most likely scenario seems to be that I'll stay here until the end of the year, then join Jessica in Carbondale and <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">be unemployed</span> do freelance work.<br>So the next few months will double as both a stalling tactic in making a major transition and a chance to save up some money with both of us working full-time jobs at the same time before I no longer have steady income. It will also give me a chance to hone my musical skills if I am left with no choice but to become a world-famous musician for a living.<br>It's all rather up in the air right now, but worst case scenario: Jessica works full-time, I try to make more than I spend online, and we adopt a lower-cost lifestyle than we've been living lately. I trust we can get by without the money fires.<br><img src="http://static.flickr.com/7/7102817_44051b867c.jpg" /><br><p class="caption">Photo from <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/slightclutter/7102817/">slight clutter</a>
