<a href="http://www.westerniowaadvantage.com/">The Western Iowa Advantage website</a> went "live" (no longer a placeholder) yesterday. I've been working on it, along with other people and among other projects, for the past month or so. Everyone at work seems pretty excited about the result. I suspect the enthusiasm is largely due to the visual look of the site. It's pretty. People like pretty.<br>But what I find most interesting about the site is something no one else will ever notice: it's very semantic. The markup describes the data. The news is all <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom">hatom</a>, the events are all <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcalendar">hcalendar</a>, and the personal and organization information is all <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard">hcard</a>. You can run <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/software/firefox/greasemonkey/googlehcalendar/">my greasemonkey</a> script and import the events into Google Calendar. You can run the hcards through <a href="http://suda.co.uk/projects/X2V/">Brian Suda's X2V</a> and get them into your address book. You can use <a href="http://placenamehere.com/article/185/SubscribingTohAtomFeedsWithNetNewsWire">Chris Casciano's NetNewsWire script</a> to subscribe to the news without bothering with a separate feed (although there is a separate feed too).<br>And who is going to do these things? I expect absolutely no one. Certainly no one I know of using the site. So why do I bother? I don't know. I don't know why I like data so much. I don't know why people like pretty things so much. Maybe some day I'll figure it all out. Meanwhile, I make websites.
