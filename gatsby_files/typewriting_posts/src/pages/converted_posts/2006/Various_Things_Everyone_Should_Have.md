<p><a href="http://www.zenshiatsuchicago.org/people/steve_rogne/">Steve Rogne</a> is a friend of mine from university days. We were apartment mates for about a year and a half. He recently became the Director of <a href="http://www.zenshiatsuchicago.org/">Zen Shiatsu Chicago</a>. I've done a bit of revamping of their website for him, including giving Steve <a href="http://www.zenshiatsuchicago.org/people/steve_rogne/">his own URL</a> (because <a href="http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/71">everyone should have a URL</a>). I hope to get a blog set up for them soon (because everyone should have a blog). Speaking of blogs and new jobs, <a href="http://bookowl.blogspot.com/2006/07/flash-of-news.html">Dan has both</a> (as everyone should).</p><br><p>Back to me. Last week I met with the bassist &#8212; let's call him "Chris" (because that's his name) &#8212; and we "jammed." Whenever anyone talks about "jamming," I think of it as some sort of improvisational music performance that I don't know how to do. But really it's just short hand for "playing music." At least that's what we did. It went okay for the first time. It looks tentatively like the makings of a band (because everyone should have a band).</p><br><p>Speaking of bands, a week from now Jessica and I are having a wedding (because <a href="http://www.hrc.org/Template.cfm?Section=Center&amp;Template=/TaggedPage/TaggedPageDisplay.cfm&amp;TPLID=63&amp;ContentID=17353">everyone should have a wedding</a>). As far as the state of Iowa is concerned, we were actually married back in January, but the ceremony will be next weekend, and as far as our grandmothers are concerned, no ceremony means to marriage. We've attempted to plan it such that it will be more fun than stressful, so hopefully it will turn out that way.</p><br><p>If you're interested in showcasing your home for a chance to win &#8230; looks like about $25,000 in prizes &#8230; <a href="http://promotions.benjaminmoore.com/">Benjamin Moore's current promotion</a> began at 12am yesterday morning. I made the entry form. I also recently worked on the website for <a href="http://www.icminc.com/">ICM</a>, so if you need some work done on your ethanol refinery (because everyone should have an ethanol refinery), I recommend checking that out.</p><br><p>If you don't yet have a URL, a blog, a new job, a band, a wedding, or an ethanol refinery, please let me know if I can be of any assistance. Because really, everyone should.</p>
