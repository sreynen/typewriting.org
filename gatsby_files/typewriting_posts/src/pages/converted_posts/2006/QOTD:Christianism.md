<blockquote><p>That's what I dissent from, and I dissent from it as a Christian. I dissent from the political pollution of sincere, personal faith. I dissent most strongly from the attempt to argue that one party represents God and that the other doesn't. I dissent from having my faith co-opted and wielded by people whose politics I do not share and whose intolerance I abhor. The word Christian belongs to no political party. It's time the quiet majority of believers took it back.</p></blockquote><br><p>&#8212; <cite><a href="http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,1191826,00.html">Andrew Sullivan in Time Magazine</a></cite></p><br><p>I have a problem with trying to redefine what words mean when you don't like the group you've placed yourself in (Sullivan's been unsuccessfully taking back "Republican" for several years now), but it's certainly better than just ignoring the corruption.</p>
