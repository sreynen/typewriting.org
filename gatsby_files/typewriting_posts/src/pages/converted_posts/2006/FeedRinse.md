<a href="http://www.feedrinse.com/">Feed Rinse</a> appears to do what my <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/rssfilter/">RSS filter</a> has done for about two years, only better, prettier, and for money. This seems to be a recurring theme with my projects. I continue to be surprised by what people will pay for. But maybe that's a good thing.
