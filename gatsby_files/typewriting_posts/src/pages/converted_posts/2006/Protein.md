<p>A few days ago, I got a new laptop from work. It's a MacBook Pro, and I really like it. I've moved all of my old files and applications over from my old laptop, checked that everything is working okay, installed Parallels to use for testing in Internet Explorer, and played Minesweeper in Windows XP. With all of those important tasks out of the way, I started playing with a new application that came on the new laptop: <a href="http://plasq.com/comiclife">Comic Life</a>.</p><br><p>As the name suggests, Comic Life makes it easy to make comic strips. It's a lot of fun to use, and my first completed comic, previously destined to be an article with far too many words and too few pictures, is below.</p><br><img src="http://typewriting.org/image/article/content/comic/protein/page_1.jpg" alt="Comic: Protein: page 1" /><br><img src="http://typewriting.org/image/article/content/comic/protein/page_2.jpg" alt="Comic: Protein: page 2" /><br><p>This was inspired by <a href="http://dontoearth.blogspot.com/2006/11/cannibals-all-or-you-eat-what-you-are.html">an article on Don to Earth</a> (and many conversations I've had about protein).
