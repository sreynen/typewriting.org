I'm moving most of my tech geek posts to <a href="http://log.makedatamakesense.com/">a new WordPress blog on my MakeDataMakeSense.com domain</a>. No wait &#8212; not blog, log.

And for those of you who have suffered through the tech talk in hopes I might get around to discussing what I'm eating or whatever (that's right, mom, I'm talking about you), suffer no more. I had cheese and crackers for dinner. The crackers were multi-grain, so that counts as a healthy dinner, right?<br>There's more exciting insight into the life of Scott where that came from! Stay tuned. Or retune. The choice is now up to you.
