<p>Thanks to <a href="http://www.blogant.com/">Steve Rioux</a>'s translation help, I put up a <a href="http://randomchaos.com/games/fastr/fr/">French version of fastr</a> today. I also updated the <a href="http://randomchaos.com/games/fastr/es/">Spanish version</a> with the changes I've made recently. And I removed the remote mirrors, for now at least. I'll see what the traffic looks like tomorrow and maybe remove the mirror page altogether. For today, at least, it was calm enough to handle on one server. If anyone wants to do translations for other languages (or fix my errors on the existing translations), let me know.</p>
