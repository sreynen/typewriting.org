After making some improvements and posting to <a href="http://projects.metafilter.com/">MeFi projects</a>, there were just 72 people playing <a href="http://randomchaos.com/games/fastr/">fastr</a> at the same time. Surprisingly enough, it's still working. The first website I saw pointing to it was <a href="http://www.tecnicalia.com/2006/01/22/tec_fastr-juego-con-las-fotos-de-flickr/">Tecnicalia</a>, a Spanish tech blog. That made me think maybe it was worthwhile making <a href="http://randomchaos.com/games/fastr/es/">a Spanish version</a>. I thought it would be a fun way to practice a second language, and also let Spanish speakers play in their first language. But I haven't seen anyone playing it yet.
