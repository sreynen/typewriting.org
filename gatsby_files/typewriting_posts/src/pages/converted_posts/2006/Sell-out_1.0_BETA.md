<p>As I move projects to <a href="http://makedatamakesense.com/">MakeDataMakeSense.com</a>, I'm giving everything a pretty icon and otherwise trying to make it look more "professional," under the theory that people are more likely to pay attention to something that looks like it might be for sale. And this is apparently working as evidenced by one project now <a href="http://momb.socio-kybernetics.net/beta/google-hcalendar">listed in the Museum of Modern Betas</a> as a "beta by inheritance." I guess I just need to tack a meaningless "beta" icon on everything to complete the sell-out process (without actually selling anything). </p>
