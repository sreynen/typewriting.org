<p><a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/08/marketing_moral.html">Seth Godin</a> writes:</p><br><blockquote><p>We're responsible for what we sell and how we sell it. We're responsible for the effects (and the side effects) of our actions.</p><br><p>It is our decision. Whatever the decision is, you need to own it. If you can't look that decision in the mirror, market something else.</p></blockquote><br><p>I was surprised he wrote this because I gather Seth's readership is primarily marketers, and he generally tells them, or I should say us, things we like to hear, e.g. from the same post: <q>Marketing (the use of time and money to create a story and spread it) works.</q> I guess that candy coating was added to sweeten a medicine that no one, in marketing or otherwise, really wants to swallow: you're responsible for your own actions.</p><br><p>I was somewhat worried about this responsiblity when I accepted my current job at an advertising agency, but in the past year I haven't really been asked to help sell anything I feel bad about. Helping sell beef is the closest I've come to an ethical compromise, as I'm vegetarian. But I'm the kind of vegetarian who finds this amusing:</p><br><img src="http://typewriting.org/image/article/content/meat_is_murder.jpg"  alt="MEAT IS MURDER. Tasty, tasty murder." /><br><p class="caption">Photo source unknown</p><br><p>It seems I'm lucky to be working at an agency with pretty good clients, and most people who work in this industry are making a lot of ethical compromises they would rather not think about in terms of personal responsibility. So I don't expect Seth's post on this topic is going to sell many books. But I was pleasantly surprised to read it.</p>
