If you're interested in seeing new tags on fastr, I've added a <a href="http://randomchaos.com/games/fastr/suggest_a_tag/">suggest-a-tag page</a> for the English version (the only version getting much play), which will check if the tag is already in use, and point you to the related flickr page to verify the tag is guess-able form the photos. The suggested tags will be reviewed by Jessica or I periodically and added if deemed appropriate.
