<a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dave_rogers/GHD06-06.html#note_2833">Dave Rogers points</a> to <a href="http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge183.html">Jarod Lanier</a>, who has better ideas than me regarding the tendancy of the web to ignore individuals. He writes:<br><blockquote>The illusion that what we already have is close to good enough, or that it is alive and will fix itself, is the most dangerous illusion of all. By avoiding that nonsense, it ought to be possible to find a humanistic and practical way to maximize value of the collective on the Web without turning ourselves into idiots. The best guiding principle is to always cherish individuals first.</blockquote><br>That's exactly the illusion I've been working under on the web for the past decade. I thought if I just threw good ideas into the web long enough, it would improve itself. <a href="http://lyricwiki.org/Radiohead:Fake_Plastic_Trees">It wears me out</a>. "Always cherish individuals first" sounds like pretty good advice. I think I haven't been doing enough of that because I don't trust individuals very much. Individuals can be mean. The collective, at worst, is just careless. And therein lies the appeal of the illusion: it's relatively safe.<br>But I've had enough with the relative safety of the idiot hive mind. It's time for me to get back to mess and the riskiness of smart individuals. So &#8230; anyone want to start a website with me? I have a lot of good ideas.
