By "independent voter," I mean that I will give any candidate an opportunity to earn my vote, regardless of party affiliation. This seems like the common sense basis of democracy to me, but I don't know many people who do this.</p><br><p>In the past, I've asked a lot of a candidate wishing to earn my vote. Candidates had to somehow insert themselves into the various media I consume, e.g. radio, billboards, weblogs, showing up at my house, etc. If they failed to make themselves known to me, I voted based on what I knew of their opponent. If all candidates in a given race failed to do so, I voted based on a statistical correlation between party affiliation and my previous voting preferences. That is, I voted for Democrats because I tend to like Democrats.</p><br><p>This last part doesn't make me feel very independent, especially when this actually happens a lot. Most elections I vote in are minor local and regional offices and I know nothing about the individual candidates. This year I voted absentee (which anyone can do in Iowa and many other states), so I could take my time to research these candidates and avoid resorting to party affiliation guesswork for any of my votes.</p><br><p>After many hours of researching, I'm happy to say I didn't vote for anyone based on their party affiliation, but I did vote for a few based on something other than the information I was able to find. This is because I wasn't able to find much information. So I applied my same criteria as before, only this time I was actively seeking out information.</p><br><p>If I couldn't find anything about a candidate in a Google search, I voted based on what I knew about the opposing candidates. And if I couldn't find any information about any candidates in a race, I voted based on gender. That's admittedly not the best way to vote, and maybe I should have just not voted at all in those races, but I'm comfortable taking that gamble in the interest of getting more women in elected offices of government. In any case, I managed to vote without preference to party, which is important to me. </p><br><p>With that as my independent voting strategy, I will go through specifically who I voted for and why in the next few posts.</p><br><div class="clear"></div>
