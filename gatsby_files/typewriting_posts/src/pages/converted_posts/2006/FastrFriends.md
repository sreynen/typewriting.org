Aaron Barker made a JavaScript bookmarklet to track other players on <a href="http://randomchaos.com/games/fastr/">fastr</a>, called <a href="http://www.zelph.com/releases/fastrfriends/">FastrFriends</a>. It's a cool idea. Basically you click on a player's name, and it will keep the name highlighted in the score list. So if you're playing against people you know, you can easily watch their scores.<br>In my testing, it didn't work in Safari for some reason, but it worked fine in Firefox. I didn't try it in IE.
