But then I started listing the shows I watch, and it turns out I'm not as selective as I'd imagined. I subscribe to both <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/index.jhtml">the Daily Show</a> and <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_colbert_report/index.jhtml">the Colbert Report</a> (despite Comedy Centrals craptacular website). I watch <a href="http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/I/itcrowd/">the IT crowd</a> when it's available to download (which it hasn't been recently - what happened to it?). I just started watching <a href="http://www.zefrank.com/theshow/">Ze Frank's the Show</a>, but that doesn't really count, does it?<br>I once had my calendar remind me to watch both <a href="http://www.fox.com/arresteddev/">Arrested Development</a> and <a href="http://www.thesimpsons.com/">the Simpsons</a>, but then Arrested Development was cancelled, and I started watching <a href="http://www.nbc.com/The_West_Wing/">the West Wing</a> after, and then instead of, the Simpsons. The West Wing is ending soon, and I don't expect I'll go back to watching the Simpsons regularly, so my calendar shows are over.<br>Jessica was bringing home <a href="http://www.usanetwork.com/series/monk/">Monk</a> DVDs from the library, and that's the only show I like to watch, but would not claim is quality television. It has completely unbelievable characters and plots, but I like it anyway. I won't be watching that, though, until the library gets the next season on DVD.  I'll watch CSI or Law and Order if they're on the TV when I'm in the room, but I won't go out of my way to find them.<br>And then there's BSG. So though I'll soon be able to say that BSG is one of only three shows I watch, and the only one not available as a free download, my viewing is not so refined just yet. Still, as someone who *will be* a discriminating viewer, I give BSG my seal of approval, for whatever that's worth. You should watch it if you haven't.
