<blockquote>I'm a 2nd Degree Decided, if I get kicked in the face by a yellow belt, that's <i>my fault.</i> Sympathy can be found in the dictionary between "shit" and "syphilis." So I got a bloody nose, and a reminder to <i>pay attention.</i></blockquote><br>&#8212; <cite><a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dave_rogers/GHD09-06.html#note_2999">Dave Rogers</a></cite>
