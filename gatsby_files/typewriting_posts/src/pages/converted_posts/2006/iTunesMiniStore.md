<p>Boing Boing has been going on about iTune's new mini store for two days now, and it was <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/11/itunes_update_spies_.html">interesting at first</a>, but now <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/11/steve_jobs_apple_dis.html">it's starting to get a little silly</a>. Some facts not mentioned on Boing Boing:</p><br><ol><br><li>The mini store doesn't show up at all until after you've purchased songs via the iTunes music store. So it *is* off by default. It's just few of those worried about it are still in the default state.</li><br><li>The site receiving the data from iTunes, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%222o7.net%22">2o7.net, collects similar data from hundreds of popular websites</a>, including Comedy Central. For example, when you're watching the Daily Show, <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aboingboing.net+%22daily+show%22">much celebrated on Boing Boing</a>, 2o7.net is tracking every video clip you watch.</li><br></ol>
