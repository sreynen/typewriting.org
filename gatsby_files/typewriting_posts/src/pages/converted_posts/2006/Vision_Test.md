<p>Here is a picture of a stem cell from <a href="http://www.wellcome.ac.uk/en/bia/gallery.html?image=13">the Biomedical Image Awards 2006</a>:</p><br><img src="http://typewriting.org/image/article/content/stem_cell.jpg" alt="stem cell" /><br><p>Here is a picture of me, taken a few weeks ago as I tried on my friend <a href="http://philogyny.net/">Phil</a>'s glasses:</p><br><img src="http://typewriting.org/image/article/content/scott_glasses.jpg" alt="Scott Reynen wearing glasses" /><br><p>Phil's glasses improved my vision slightly, but I don't wear glasses because the improvement isn't consistent over time. I have juvenile diabeties, so my blood glucose levels don't remain steady, and when they fluxuate, my vision blurs. Apparently the shape of our eyes is somewhat dependent on the amount of glucose in our blood.</p><br><p>Anyway, I present these two pictures here as an exercise for you, the reader. I don't have perfect vision, so maybe you can see better than I can: which of these looks more like a person who could use <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5193998.stm">help from the government</a>?</p>
