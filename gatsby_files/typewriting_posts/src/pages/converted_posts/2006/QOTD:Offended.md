<blockquote>I'm offended. Those people, by their actions, have demonstrated the essentially corrupt nature of their society and culture. Their behaviour, which all right-minded people should be offended by, should be universally condemned. If anything shows that we are right and they are wrong, this is it. </blockquote><br>&#8212; <cite><a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2006/02/06/im-offended/">Chris Bertram</a></cite>
