<blockquote>Humanity i love you because you<br /><br>are perpetually putting the secret of<br /><br>life in your pants and forgetting<br /><br>it's there and sitting down</blockquote><br>&#8212; <a href="http://www.cstone.net/~romie/cummings/humanity.html">e. e. cummings</a>. I'm still reading through cummings' poems looking for music. I'm not sure I have a melody for this one, but I really like it.
