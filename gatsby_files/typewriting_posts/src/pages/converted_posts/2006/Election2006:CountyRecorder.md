Tim Brien is the incumbent, but he lost the primary to Julie M. Haggerty. As I mentioned <a href="http://typewriting.org/2006/10/18/Election_2006%3A_Secretary_of_State/">earlier</a>, he <a href="http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060624/NEWS05/606240322/1001">intially blamed Michael Mauro</a>, Commissioner of Elections, implying that he rigged the election. But then he <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060806/NEWS05/608060347/-1/archive">dropped his challenge</a>, saying he didn't believe he could get a fair result.<br>Apparently he does think he can get a fair result in the general election, even though Michael Mauro is still Commissioner of Elections, because he's running as an independent. So I don't trust Tim Brien, and this distrust makes me like Michael Mauro and Julie M. Haggerty more.<br>The third candidate is <a href="http://www.chrishagenow.com/">Christopher D. Hagenow</a>, running as a Republican. If you follow that link to his website, and the link from there to <a href="http://hagenowforrecorder.blogspot.com/">his blog</a>, you' notice he doesn't talk about issues much, and he seems as interested in the Nussle for Governor campaign as his own. As I mentioned in <a href="http://typewriting.org/2006/10/17/2006_Election%3A_Governor/">my discussion of the Governor race</a>, I don't trust Nussle, so by association, I distrust Hagenow.<br>If it wasn't already obvious, I voted for Julie M. Haggerty for County Recorder.<br><div class="clear"></div>
