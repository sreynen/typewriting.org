<blockquote><p>If you're an angry driver, you'll flip someone the bird or ride their bumper or cause an accident. You can tell yourself that those other drivers are assholes, but it's just fear. If you're a multi-millionaire, you'll hire a lawyer to intimidate someone to give you what you want when you want it, so they won't do something that you can't control. You'll tell yourself it's just business, but it's really just fear. If you're a country with an anxiety problem, you'll attack another country. You'll tell yourself it's a matter of national security, but it's just fear. None of which ever solves the problem. All of which create bigger problems of their own.</p></blockquote><br><p>&#8212; <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dave_rogers/GHD03-06.html#note_2703"><cite>Dave Rogers, Getting Back to Normal</cite></a></p>
