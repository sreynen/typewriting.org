If <a href="http://typewriting.org/2006/08/09/The_New_Songs/">last week</a>'s album of the week was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mermaid_Avenue">Mermaid Avenue</a> by Billy Bragg and Wilco, this week's is <a href="http://lyricwiki.org/Decemberists%2C_The:Her_Majesty_%282003%29">Her Majesty</a> by the Decemberists. Here are my new songs:<br><ul><br><li><a href="http://lyricwiki.org/Decemberists%2C_The:Los_Angeles%2C_I%27m_Yours">Los Angeles, I'm Yours</a> &#8212; The Decemberists</li><br><li><a href="http://lyricwiki.org/Decemberists%2C_The:I_Was_Meant_For_The_Stage">I was Meant for the Stage</a> &#8212; The Decemberists</li><br><li>8th Grade Graduation &#8212; me</li><br></ul><br>That last one was written this week and I haven't even recorded it yet. I think it sounds sort of like the Decemberists. It's inspired by <a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/archrndwn/2005/aug/050806.waitwait.html">Senator Barack Obama's appearance on Wait Wait, Don't Tell Me in August of 2005</a>, during which he discussed his controversial position that 8th grade graduation should not exist. I attempted to explore the benefits of 8th grade graduation in song form, with a chorus of "Your 8th grade graduation is a day that you'll remember for the rest of the night."<br>As a reminder, I'm playing 9pm-12am at the Continental Lounge in Des Moines on Wednesday, August 16th, tomorrow.
