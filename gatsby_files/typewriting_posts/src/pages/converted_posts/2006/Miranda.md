I was just reading about Miranda warnings, looking for evidence that we don't lose our rights if we're arrested for murder, much less <a href="http://durangoherald.com/asp-bin/article_generation.asp?article_type=news&amp;article_path=/news/06/news061126_2.htm">when we join a homeowners association</a>. I've seen a surprising number of Americans suggesting otherwise today. But much more interesting than a "Satanic" peace wreath (<a href="http://typewriting.org/2003/12/26/on_the_side_of_humanity/#content">I totally saw that coming</a>) was <a href="http://www.asu.edu/news/campus/stuart_mirandabook_093004.htm">this</a>:<br><blockquote>Ten years after the ruling in the case that bears his name, Miranda was killed in a knife fight at a Phoenix bar; his suspected killer was read the "Miranda warning" and declined to give a statement. He was released and promptly fled to Mexico. The Miranda murder case became a "closed file."</blockquote><br>That's the problem with rights: everyone has them.
