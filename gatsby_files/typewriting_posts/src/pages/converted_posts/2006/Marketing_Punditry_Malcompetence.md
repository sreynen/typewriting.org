<p>I have trouble mustering the anger at <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/">marketing</a> <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/">pundits</a> that <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/dave_rogers/">Dave Rogers</a> so often can. Not only would it be incredibly awkward, as I work at an advertising agency, but I just don't think marketing is the problem. I'm not sure what exactly the problem is, but I think marketing is just a symptom. And punditry about marketing is further a symptom of a symptom. Marketing pundits are no more marketers than political pundits are politicians.</p><br><p>That said, when I read Seth Godin <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2006/05/yolks_are_to_eg.html">saying</a> <q>Marketing, at its core, is about teaching somebody something that they didn't know,</q> I can't help but get a bit upset. He's either blatantly lying or he has no idea what he's talking about. Let's just call it <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/50081#1246377">malcomptence</a>.</p><br><p>Marketing, at its core, is about selling something. That it occasionally teaches in the process is a nice unintended consequence, but how anyone could really believe education is the core of marketing long enough to type the sentence is beyond me. Back when he was actually a marketer, Seth Godin <a href="http://www.fastcompany.com/online/14/permission.html">wrote</a> <q>Marketing is a contest for people's attention.</q> That at least has some relation to reality. Education also involves getting people's attention. But so does electroshock therapy. No one makes a living saying nonsense like "Marketing, at it's core, is electroshock therapy."</p>
