The two candidates are John F. Mauro, running as a Democrat, and Gene Phillips, on the ballot by petition. This happens to be the <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2006608240390">fourth time</a> these two candidates have run against each other. In the 1998 Democratic primary, Mauro won by less than three hundred votes. Then Phillips ran as an independent in the general election and won, also by less than three hundred votes. Then in 2002, Mauro ran against Phillips again and won, this time by a substantial margin.<br>So Mauro is the incumbent and he won last time. But he's also on the CIETC board, and although he doesn't have the direct connection to corruption that <a href="http://typewriting.org/2006/10/23/Election_2006%3A_State_Representative/">Abdul-Samad appears to have</a>, it doesn't really look good for anyone on that board. Mauro's best response to the attention was <q>Hopefully, they won't hold me responsible for something I didn't have any control over.</q><br>Well, I do hold him responsible for the lack of control. And it's also Phillips' turn to win. Oh yeah, and Mauro <a href="http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061010/OPINION01/610100387">doesn't live in the district</a>. So I voted for Gene Phillips.<br><div class="clear"></div>
