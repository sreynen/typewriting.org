<p>This is how much of a web geek I am: when I read the headline <q><a href="http://www.livescience.com/technology/060330_frictionless_spinning.html">Atom Breaks Rules, Beats Friction</a></q>, I assumed it was regarding <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc4287.txt">RFC4287</a>. Turns out it's just about an actual atom breaking the rules of physics.</p>
