<p>I've recorded and posted <a href="http://music.typewriting.org/mp3s/scott_reynen/8th_grade_graduation.mp3">an MP3 of 8th Grade Graduation</a> as well as <a href="http://music.typewriting.org/lyrics/scott_reynen/8th_grade_graduation">lyrics</a>. As I said <a href="http://typewriting.org/2006/08/15/Decemberists_Week/">last week</a>, it's inspired by Barak Obama's courageous stance against 8th grade graduations. I played it last Wednesday, and I think it went quite well. Afterward, a man at the bar said he liked it, but hadn't heard it before. So I guess he thought it was a cover of some radio musician he might have heard. Maybe that's just because it sounds more like a pop songs than my other music, but I prefer to think it's because of my excellent songwriting abilities.</p>
