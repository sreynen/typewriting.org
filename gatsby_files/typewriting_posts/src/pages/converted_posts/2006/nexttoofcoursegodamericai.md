<cite>next to of course god america i</cite> (<a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/mp3s/scott_reynen/next_to_of_course_god_america_i.mp3">MP3</a>, <a href="http://music.randomchaos.com/lyrics/scott_reynen/next_to_of_course_god_america_i">lyrics</a>) is the second song I've recorded with lyrics from e. e. cummings. (The first was <a href="http://typewriting.org/2003/12/16/anyone_lived_in_a_pretty_how_town/">anyone lived in a pretty how town</a>, which I need to re-record.) So far I've written four songs. I expect I'll eventually have a whole album's worth. I like e. e. cummings' poems, and I find the songs are easy to write. It's also more fun to listen to songs with lyrics someone else wrote. I don't generally like listening to my own music, but I don't mind with these e. e. cummings songs.
