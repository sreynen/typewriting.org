title: "Tag Cloud"

<p>In case you were wondering what I tend to write about here, I just made what the web geeks call <a href="http://typewriting.org/tag/">a "tag cloud" for these articles</a>. It's weighted to recent writing because I only started adding tags to my articles recently.</p><br><p>I was actually a bit surprised that politics is the most common tag, but I suspect that's more a reflection of my tagging style than my writing topics. I think I actually write more about technology than politics (though I no longer write about technology at all here since I started <a href="http://log.makedatamakesense.com/">a separate site for that</a>), but I tend to tag the technology articles with something more specific than "technology," whereas the various political topics all just go under "politics."</p>
