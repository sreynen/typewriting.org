<blockquote><p>This kind of thing -- publicly shaming a person for rude behavior by posting voice recordings, video, and photos on the Web -- is becoming very common -- <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003085820_btdownload26.html">sidekick thief</a>, <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/340923p-291030c.html">subway flasher</a>, <a href="http://lostcamera.blogspot.com/">camera thief</a>, <a href="http://japundit.com/archives/2005/06/30/808/">subway puppy poo girl</a>. Who needs law enforcement when you have a globally distributed mob ready to pounce on people who are accused of behaving badly?</p></blockquote><br><p>&#8212; <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/06/30/voicemails_from_guy_.html"><cite>Mark Frauenfelder, BoingBoing</cite></a>. I hope that's sarcasm? Personally, I prefer laws to mobs.</p>
