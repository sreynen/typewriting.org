This is the first race involving <a href="http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?Category=NEWS&amp;theme=JOB_TRAINING_EXECUTIVES&amp;template=theme">the CIETC scandal</a>. Apparently a lot of money went into the Central Iowa Employment and Training Consortium, and not a lot of employment and training came out. Ako Abdul-Samad, running as a Democrat, was on the CIETC board, and didn't convince me that he was innocent of the <a href="http://www.dmregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060801/NEWS10/608010384/1001&amp;lead=1">corruption charges</a> being tossed at him. He lost my vote.</p><br><p>Jack Whitver, running as a Republican, successfully lost my vote by <a href="http://whotv.com/Global/story.asp?S=5430717">showing up at Abdul-Samad's house after being told Abdul-Samad was unavailable due to family illness</a>. Even assuming charitably that Abdul-Samad was lying about the family illness, that still makes Whitver a political moron.</p><br><p>Luckily I have two other candidates in this race. Brett Blanchfield, running as a Libertarian, gets points for being the only candidate to bother answering <a href="	http://www.growthevote.org/php.asp?g=iowa&amp;page=Candidate_Guide&amp;legdistrictid=1944<br>">a candidate survey from the Iowa Prosperity Project</a>. And he also gets points for <a href="http://www.shrinkiowagov.org/district66.html">living just a few houses down from me</a>. But he's campaigning on issues like <a href="http://blanchfield66.blogspot.com/2006/10/blanchfield-begins-radio-advertising.html">repealing the mandatory seatbelt law</a>. I can sympathize with the general libertarian desire to streamline government, but if seatbelts are the first (or second, or even twentieth) place a candidate identifies waste in government, he's lost my vote.</p><br><p>That leaves only Jeff Johannsen. Lucky for me, Johannsen looks like a candidate for whom I can vote without reservation. He <q>wants to help make health insurance more available and affordable to small businesses and neighborhoods [...] to increase availability of assisted living to those with low to moderate incomes [...] to promote the cleanup of neighborhoods and discourages urban sprawl,</q> according to the <a href="http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS09/60626013">Des Moines Register</a>. That all sounds good to me, so I voted for Johannsen.</p><br><div class="clear"></div>
