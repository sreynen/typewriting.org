In addition to most of <a href="http://typewriting.org/2006/07/06/July_7_Set_Lists/">the songs I played previously</a>, new additions will include:</p><br><ul><br><li><a href="http://www.lyricwiki.org/Lyle_Lovett:If_I_Had_A_Boat">If I had a Boat</a> &#8212; Lyle Lovett</li><br><li><a href="http://lyricwiki.org/George_Harrison:Here_Comes_The_Sun">Here Comes the Sun</a> &#8212; George Harrison</li><br><li>I Wish I was Single Again &#8212; traditional folk (I can't find the lyrics I sing online)</li><br></ul><br><p>This my attempt to be upbeat and start pontificating on relationships now that I'm married. Jessica assures me she likes the song.</p>
