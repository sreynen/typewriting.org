<p>A few people have suggested that I should make a memory-style game based on flickr images. As I have told these people, this game was already made a long time ago. It's called <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/pair/">Flick-a-Pair</a>. As chance would have it, the person who made this game, <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/">Shelley Powers</a>, was also the <a href="http://typewriting.org/2006/01/21/Fastr/#comment-1708">first to play fastr</a> (from outside my house).</p><br><p>I don't have any plans to make another version of Flick-a-Pair, nor any other flickr-based game. It's fun to be famous on the internet for a day or two, but it just doesn't pay well enough to be worth all the time involved. I'm willing to waste my time on fastr, because I'd just be otherwise wasting my time playing some other game (most likely at <a href="http://www.kurnik.org/">Kurnik</a>). But fastr is just not the business opportunity many have mistaken it for. It's just a fun little game.</p>
