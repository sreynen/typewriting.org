<p>My friend Dan wrote <a href="http://bookowl.blogspot.com/2006/08/one-year-ago.html">an interesting post on his experience leaving New Orleans during Katrina and starting a new life here in Des Moines</a>, which I would quote, but it's short enough that I'd be quoting the whole thing. So you should just go read it. I think it speaks well of Dan that he's able to add some much-needed optimism to an awful situation.</p>
