I am trying to rate the track so that my liking it will be remembered.</p></blockquote><br><p>&#8212; <cite><a href="http://ezrakilty.net/ezlog/archives/000866.html">Ezra Kilty</a></cite></p><br><p>I had a similar experience when I first started using my iPod. I would do key commands on my laptop to rate the song, not realizing that it wasn't playing on my computer any more.</p>
