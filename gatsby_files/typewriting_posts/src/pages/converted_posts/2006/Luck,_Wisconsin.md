<p>In the spring of 2002 (if I remember correctly), I joined many of my university friends on a weekend trip to Luck, Wisconsin. We stayed on a farm with some kind folks who showed us how they use solar heating and electricity, convert their waste water to fertilizer, and generally remain self-sufficient.</p><br><p>According to <a href="http://www.defensetech.org/archives/002531.html">DefenseTech</a> (via <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/06/23/clowns_sabotage_minu.html">BoingBoing</a>), earlier this week, those same folks dressed up as clowns and broke into a nuclear missile silo. <q>The FBI is involved in the case and federal charges are pending.</q> I just wanted to point out to anyone paying attention amidst the cries of treason that I've met these people, and they are nice, normal people with whom you'd easily make friends. They just really dislike nuclear weapons.</p>
