<p><a href="http://blog.flickr.com/flickrblog/2006/08/great_shot_wher.html">Flickr's new mapping feature</a> is very cool. I've only eaten gellato once in my life, and it was bought from the same shop as the cone this boy is eating, and eaten while looking out the same window:</p><br><img src="http://static.flickr.com/1/319539_3c21ddc76d.jpg" /><br><p class="caption">Photo by <a href="http://flickr.com/photos/gensyn/319539/">robbed</a> on Flickr</p><br><p>It's something I never would have found without the mapping feature, and I'm amazed at how much it makes me miss places I've been before. That gellato was really good.</p>
