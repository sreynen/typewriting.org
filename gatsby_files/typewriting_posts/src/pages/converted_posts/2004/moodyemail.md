i'd like an email client that had a "done" button rather than the standard "send" button. then when i click "done", it would ask me what my mood is, with choices like "happy", "angry", "sad", "tired", and so on. some of these choices would send the email and others would save the email to be reviewed later. this would keep me from sending emails i might later regret, and as a side benefit, it could keep a record of my moods for later inspection. it could even integrate with filters. i could have a special inbox for email that will probably make me sad.
