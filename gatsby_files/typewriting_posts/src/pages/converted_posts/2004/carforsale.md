<p>i have a car i'm selling, if you are or know anyone in the market. it's a red 1988 honda accord two door hatchback stick shift with about 67,000 miles. i think it's a good, cheap car, but i don't know much about cars.  i've had it for about 9 months and had only a few minor problems with it, but i just inherited a nicer car so i'm selling it now for $1000. the <a href="http://www.kbb.com/">blue book</a> price is $1580. you'd need to pick it up in bloomington, il, and ideally you'd be someone i've spoken to before. email me for more details if you're interested.</p>
