<p><a href="http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/2/26/175722/727">a post on kuro5hin</a> starts with <q>Japanese is the perfect language for nerds.</q> and goes on to explain japanese as if it were a programming language. this was basically my approach with my <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/japanese.php">daily japanese lessons</a>, though not as explicitly. but like the author of this article, i think japanese has an unwarranted reputation of being a complicated language. you can do far more with single words in japanese than you can in english, and the number of exceptions to linguistic rules is much lower in japanese than english. if there were more japanese textbooks written entirely in romanized japanese, i think it would be an easier language than spanish for most american high school students.</p>
