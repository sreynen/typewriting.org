title: "a darwinian explains religion"

<p><a href="http://www.secularhumanism.org/library/fi/dawkins_24_5.htm">religion is a virus among the computer brains of children</a> says richard dawkins. it's interesting to see how a darwinian tries to explain the evolutionary value behind religion. but dawkin's explanation doesn't hold water. in my experience at least, children - unlike computers - don't believe everything they are told by their parents. and assuming what they are being told is a lie, those who do believe should be less - not more - likely to survive and reproduce than those who don't believe. whereas with religion the opposite appears to be true.</p>
