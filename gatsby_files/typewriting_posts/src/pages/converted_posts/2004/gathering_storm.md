<p> i'm spending the weekend in burlington, iowa. i'll leave tomorrow with new friends i've made via <a href="http://dean2004.meetup.com/" title="deanmeetup">bloomington-normal meetup for dean.</a> we're going to help create a <a href="http://iowa.deanforamerica.com/storm" title="perfect storm">"perfect storm"</a> to encourage iowa voters to attend the january 19 caucus (and vote dean!!) </p><br><p> we'll walk around in the cold and knock on strangers' doors along with thousands of other americans. and we'll say why <a href="http://www.deanforamerica.com">howard dean</a> is appealing enough as a candidate to drag us out into cold on a weekend. </p>
