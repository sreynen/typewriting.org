<p>yesterday i turned down a job teaching english in japan. the pay was decent, the hours were short, and it had health care and free housing. but it was in japan.</p><br><p>so now i'm working at a <a href="http://www.fabral.com/">sheet metal factory</a>. and i might be joining <a href="http://losvivos.com/">a local band</a>. and i'll probably be re-joining the board of directors of <a href="http://bncpj.pabn.org/">a local organization</a>. now i just need some health care. and some free housing would be nice too.</p>
