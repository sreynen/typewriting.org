the catholic church has a rule that communion wafers must be made of wheat. but some people are allergic to wheat. so what do you do if you're catholic and allergic to wheat? luckily, the chuch has been around a long time, so there's a rule for everything. in this case, the proper procedure is as follows: <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;cid=519&amp;e=12&amp;u=/ap/communion_denied">option (a): ignore your allergy, eat the communion wafer anyway, get sick, and die. if this option does not appeal to you, you can elect option (b): go to hell</a>. god thanks you for your inquiry.
