<p>i find myself checking <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/">electoral-vote.com</a> every day. i get a constant stream of polling information from various news sources, but - as many learned in 2000 - votes only matter in how they get translated into electoral votes. for example, recent nation-wide polling shows john kerry with only a very slight lead among potential voters, but that slight lead translates into a huge (118 vote) lead in the electoral college. i made <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/rss/electoral-vote.xml">an RSS feed of the more recent estimates from electoral-vote.com</a>, so i can be notified of such important news immediately, and you can too.</p>
