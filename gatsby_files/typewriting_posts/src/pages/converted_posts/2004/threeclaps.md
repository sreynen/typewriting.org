some have <a href="http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/2004/07/12/affectionate/">criticized</a> the associated press and liz sidoti for <a href="http://www.fortwayne.com/mld/journalgazette/news/nation/politics/9130942.htm">a recent article</a> about the kerry-edwards campaign, which has absolutely nothing to do with policy or politics, and everything to do with the two men appearing to be a little too happy - gay, even. but one particular sentence shows the real problem with this article, which everyone else seems to be missing: <q>The two clap each other sometimes once, often twice, on the back with both hands.</q> everyone knows the standard male-male "i'm not gay" hug has three claps (one for each word) on the back, not one or two.
