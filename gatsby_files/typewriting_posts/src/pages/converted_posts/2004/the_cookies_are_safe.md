<p>a kindly visitor recently pointed out that the <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/source.php">source code viewer</a> could be used to launch <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=xss">XSS</a> attacks. "egads!" i responded "that sounds terrible! wait...what does that mean?"</p><br><p>"they can steal your cookies!" the protector of bakery goodness replied. that's when i knew i had to take action. "NOBODY STEALS MY COOKIES!!" i shouted as i edited a few lines of code to prevent XSS attacks. and thus it was that the great cookie thievery of ought four was prevented.</p>
