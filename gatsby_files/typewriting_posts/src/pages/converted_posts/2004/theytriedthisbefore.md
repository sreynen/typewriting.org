<p>in my <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2004-02-25&amp;title=the+madness+of+king+george">previous post</a>, i wrote <q>the only amendment to the constitution that ever removed rights like this one threatens to do, prohibition, was later repealed.</q> while that was true, it turns out that history holds an even better analogy to bush's divisive amendment. <a href="http://www.corante.com/importance/archives/002111.html">ernie</a> writes:<q>In December of 1912, an amendment to the Constitution was introduced to abolish racial intermarriage.</q> we don't hear much about this one, because it didn't pass. hopefully, 90 years from now, they won't hear much about the current embarassment either.</p>
