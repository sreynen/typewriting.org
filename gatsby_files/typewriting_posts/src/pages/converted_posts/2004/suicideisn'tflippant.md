title: "suicide isn't flippant" 
---
i did <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/documents/liberation.pdf">my senior thesis on suicide (PDF)</a>, motivately largely by reading what i thought was a rather flippant reasoning given for suicide. people don't kill themselves casually. they have serious reasons, even if we fail to take those reasons seriously. i feel like the following quote from <a href="http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=domesticNews&amp;storyID=4126757">this reuters story on suicide</a> indicates a lack of understanding of these reasons:<br><blockquote>"Fighting this kind of war is clearly going to be stressful for some people," Assistant Defense Secretary for Health Affairs Dr. William Winkenwerder told reporters in an interview.</blockquote><br>how are they going to do anything about it, if "stress" is the best description they can come up with for the cause?
