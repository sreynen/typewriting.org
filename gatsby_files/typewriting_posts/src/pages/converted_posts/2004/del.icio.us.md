<p>i think <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=link:del.icio.us">everyone and their mom</a> is already using <a href="http://del.icio.us/">del.icio.us</a>. i'm going to start keeping all my links that may be remotely interesting to anyone else on <a href="http://del.icio.us/">my del.icio.us page</a>. i've been hesitant to start this because del.icio.us doesn't have any easy way to export, which means no easy way to make a backup of my links. but i find i'm increasingly using the web from different locations and different browsers, and it's not looking like i'm going to get <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/links.php">my homemade link application</a> into a usable state any time soon, so i'm going to use del.icio.us for now. if you are someone i know and you start doing the same, let me know so i can start stalking you online.</p>
