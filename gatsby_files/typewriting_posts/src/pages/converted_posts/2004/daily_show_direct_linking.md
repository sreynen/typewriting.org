<p>the <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/dailyshow.php">daily show RSS feed</a> now links directly to the windows media files. sort of. most of the files are in predictable locations, and those are linked properly. but some random ones are in odd locations and those links don't work right now. but the descriptions have a link to the page containing the obfuscated windows media files, so if the first click doesn't work, click, click again. or if you really want to see some ads, you can go to the page for that as well.</p>
