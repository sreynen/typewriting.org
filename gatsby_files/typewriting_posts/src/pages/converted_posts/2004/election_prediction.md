<p>this is my rather ignorant prediction of the outcome of the 2004 presidential election, as requested by <a href="http://mathewgross.com/blog/archives/000754.html">mathew gross</a>:</p><br><p>popular: kerry 52.2%, bush 46.6%</p><br><p>electoral: kerry: 310, bush: 228</p><br><p>the electoral is lifted straight from the "49% rule" tally i wrote about last night.</p>
