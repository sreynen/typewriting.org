<p>yesterday, the votemaster over at <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/oct/oct11.html">the electoral vote predictor</a> wrote <q>Some people have asked for a method to make their own maps selecting only pollsters favorable to their candidate. While this is theoretically possible, the computing load it would place on the server would be too much.</q> that's only true if he's using bad software. tonight i made <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/electoral-vote.php">a rough working tool</a> to do this. it will pull the polling data from the electoral vote predictor every six hours. i'll add some more options later, but you can already see how removing certain pollsters affects the results.</p>
