<p><a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=2922">brent simmons</a> wrote in a post today <q>we can't let the perfect be the enemy of the good</q>. a good search suggests this is an old saying, but i've never heard it before. i expect i'll use this many times in the future, as i tend to hang around a lot of people who often let the perfect be the enemy of the good. and i'm sure i do too.</p>
