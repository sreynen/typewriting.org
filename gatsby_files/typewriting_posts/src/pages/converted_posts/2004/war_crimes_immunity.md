<p>america never signed on to the <a href="http://www.un.org/law/icc/">international criminal court (ICC)</a>.  some say this is because america fears charges of war crimes.  <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk/2000/newsmakers/1952981.stm">henry kissinger, for example, has been accused of war crimes</a>, and <a href="http://newyorker.com/fact/content/?040524fa_fact">the iraqi prison torture investigation may lead all the way up to donald rumsfeld</a>, if not bush himself.  but the official explanation of america's disinterest in the ICC is that we don't trust the court to differentiate between legitimate and unjustified claims of war crimes. so for the past two years, we've used our veto power in the UN to get immunity from the ICC.</p><br><p>our most recent attempts to renew this immunity come at a bad time.  because we've recently committed war crimes in iraq, the official explanation looks increasingly like a mask for our fear of being held accountable for such crimes.  which is what i suspect prompted <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/">tom coates</a> to write today "The only reason to demand war crimes immunity is if you expect some of your people to purpetrate them."  this statement is untrue.  while this may indeed be the actual reason in this case, it's not the only possible reason.  i suspect tom didn't put much thought into this statement, and would revise it more if it were part of an essay rather than his link log.  i'm just pointing out the untruth of his statement, because i think such overstatement hurts a right position as much as a wrong one.</p><br><p>my position on this, if not already obvious, is that i don't think america should seek or receive immunity from war crimes prosecution in the ICC.  there may be legitimate reasons in support of such immunity, but i think they are in any case outweighed by the benefits of demonstrating that we are willing to follow the rule of law.  especially because we don't have to.</p>
