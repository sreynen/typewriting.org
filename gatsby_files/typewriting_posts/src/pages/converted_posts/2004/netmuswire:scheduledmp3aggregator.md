about a month ago netnewswire author <a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=2906">brent simmons</a> wrote "My hope is that somebody will take this as an opportunity to do something cool and write an enclosure-downloading script (perhaps an AppleScript Studio app?) that other folks can use." and <a href="http://ranchero.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=943">other people have already</a>, but the solutions have required a bit of geekiness to enable. today i'm releasing <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/software/netmuswire/">netmuswire</a>, an applescript that combines netnewswire, ical, and itunes into a scheduled mp3 aggregator. netnewswire does the aggregating, ical does the download scheduling, and itunes does the playing. there's an installer that sets everything up to run automatically, but it's easy to adjust if you don't like the default schedule - just change the ical event times. if you have netnewswire 2 and a broadband connnection, please try it out and let me know if you find any problems. it's released under the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.txt">GPL</a> in the hopes that someone will use it as a template for something else - maybe a photo aggregator, a video aggregator, an event aggregator, or a contact aggregator.
