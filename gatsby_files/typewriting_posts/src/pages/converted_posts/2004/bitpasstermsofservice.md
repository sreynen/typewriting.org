title: "bitpass terms of service" 
---
a few weeks ago, <a href="https://www.bitpass.com/">bitpass</a> introduced a new terms of service agreement and asked all users to agree to it. it's eighteen pages long and entirely filled with legal protections for bitpass. this is okay with me, but in exchange i wanted an agreement from bitpass to not use my contact information to spam me. there's no mention of this in the terms of service, so i emailed bitpass and told them i wouldn't agree to it until i had this protection. they promptly wrote back and pointed out that the terms of service includes by reference <a href="http://www.bitpass.com/learn/legal/">all policies on the bitpass website</a>, including their <a href="http://www.bitpass.com/learn/legal/Privacy.html">privacy policy</a>. "that's great," i thought to myself as i went to look at the privacy policy, only to find the following passage:<br><blockquote><b>Marketing Purposes.</b> We may disclose your personal information to third parties so they can inform you about their products or services. If you do not wish to receive these types of third party communications, you can <a href="http://www.bitpass.com/learn/legal/prefs.html">click here</a> and complete a form to tell us your preferences. While you may choose not to receive direct marketing information from third parties, you will continue to receive invoices, service impacting notifications and other similar information from us, electronically or otherwise, as well as general advertisements through our site (if any).</blockquote><br>that's not an ideal privacy policy, as the default allows bitpass to sell my email address to spammers. but at least i can opt out. of course, if you follow the opt out link, you'll find an 'under construction' page. so i wrote back to bitpass and said this agreement was unacceptable so long as it is impossible for me to prevent my contact information from being sold to others for marketing. they promptly replied that this was completely understandable and that they would create the opt out form soon. it's now a few weeks later and nothing has changed.<br>i wouldn't be in any hurry, but bitpass warns me every time i log in that if i don't accept the user agreement by january 15, i'm going to lose my account. so bitpass has 12 days left to allow me to opt out from spam, or lose me. i hope they'll meet this deadline. i also hope they'll develop a bit more interest in customer service.
