<br>i acknowledge the deeply pessimistic and potentially alarmist tone of the previous post, but will do my best to balance it here. <br><br><br>so, abandon not all your hope, for we can break away from nuclear power and still keep the lights on. we have an excellent opportunity to start right here in illinois, where the <a href="http://www.elpc.org/energy/ilrps/FactSheetSB2321OnePageGeneral.htm">renewable energy portfolio standard (rps) bill,</a>sb 2321, is currently before state legislators. also,  the state's first wind power vendor, <a href="http://www.crescentridgewind.com">the crescent ridge project,</a> is currently setting up shop.  <br><br><br>in many ways, the future of Illinois residents will best be served by continuing to bring <a href="http://www.eere.energy.gov/windpoweringamerica/where_is_wind_illinois.html">wind</a> and <a href="http://www.elpc.org/energy/renewables.html">other renewable energy technologies</a> to this state.  <br><br> <br>the crescent ridge wind-power project will soon become <a href="http://www.elpc.org/energy/ilrps/FactSheetSB2321OnePageGeneral.htm">the single largest property tax payer in bureau county, illinois.</a>  It will also bring significant income to farmers who have agreed to have turbines on their land- <a href="http://www.elpc.org/energy/ilrps/FactSheetSB2321OnePageGeneral.htm">at $5,000 annually per turbine.</a> <br><br><br>illinois has an opportunity to encourage more of this critical economic stimulus by passing senate bill 2321. sb 2321 would establish a rps as has already been done by thirteen other states- even oil-rich texas.<br> <br><br>rps sets goals for the utility market to incorporate clean, renewable energy sources like water, solar, biomass, and wind with the non-renewable and highly toxic sources like coal, gas, oil, and nuclear they are using now.  the attainable standard before our state senate would require utilities to obtain just 3% of total sales from renewable energy sources by 2007 and 10% by 2012.<br><br><br>illinois must act now, as this legislation will bring much needed economic boosts: new income sources for farmers, thousands of new jobs for workers, and tax revue for the state. go ahead and let your legislators know you want them support to senate bill 2321. <a href="http://www.danrutherford.com/">dan rutherford</a> and <a href="http://www.citizensforbillbrady.com/">bill brady</a> are especially in need of a phone call, as they haven't supported the bill yet.<br><br><br>public dialogue about improving energy is increasingly important as the floundering nuclear power industry attempts to revive itself, much to the detriment of ratepayers, public health, and rural areas.  <br><br><br>beginning with expensive uranium mining, plagued with recurring safety violations (leading to plummeting tax value), and ending with radioactive waste for which we can foresee no feasible containment, nuclear power is a disappointment, or rather a nightmare come true, for individuals and communities.<br>
