title: "myspace RSS feeds to save time"

earlier today i was doing laundry and watching C-SPAN. i don't have cable at home, so when i go to do laundry at my dad's house, i take the opportunity to watch some cable, and i usually end up watching C-SPAN, which is ironically available <a href="http://www.cspan.org/">online</a>.<br>on C-SPAN today was eric brende, the author of <cite><a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0060570040/">better off: flipping the switch on technology</a></cite>. he talked about how a lot of "time-saving" technology actually makes us lose time because we have to spend time working to pay for it, and then we have to schedule seperate time for exercising and socializing, both of which we previously did simultaneously with whatever work the technology is now performing for us.<br>that all made sense to me, so i of course went home and started working on yet another web application to save myself some time. my friend <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.ListAll&amp;friendID=6274232">jj has a new weblog on myspace.com</a>, but myspace.com doesn't have RSS feeds. i'd like to know when jj writes something without having to waste a few minutes every day checking this page, so i wrote <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/myspace.php">a script</a> to scrape the page and make an RSS feed. i think that took me a little over an hour, so this may be a good example of where "time-saving" doesn't.<br>but i made it so it will work on any myspace.com weblog, so hopefully i can save someone else enough time that this was worthwhile. if you want an RSS feed of the weblog of the lead singer of weezer, for example, you can get that <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/myspace.php?myspace=http%3A%2F%2Fblog.myspace.com%2Findex.cfm%3Ffuseaction%3Dblog.ListAll%26friendID%3D1480919">here</a>. or you could just read <a href="http://blog.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.ListAll&amp;friendID=1480919">the web page</a>, but if you're not going to use perfectly good RSS, you might as well become <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amish">amish</a>.
