<p>the <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/language/poetry.php">computer-generated poetry will now evolve</a>. now two poems show up instead of one, and when you vote for one of the two, that makes future poems more like the poem you voted for (and less like the other). it does this by remembering which words are together in poems that you like (as well as the poems you don't like), and putting words together based on that information. there's still some randomness - mutations to allow for poem evolution rather than mere poem cloning. i have no idea how well it will work. but that's what makes it fun.</p>
