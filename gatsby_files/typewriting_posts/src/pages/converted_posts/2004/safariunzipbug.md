two recent bug reports for <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/software/maillog/">mail log</a> are actually - as far as i can tell - bugs in safari. mail log doesn't work if the zip file is downloaded and unzipped with safari. if it is downloaded with safari (or any other browser) and unzipped with some other application, it works fine. this seems like an incredibly obscure bug, and i'm suspicious that i've diagnosed the problem correctly, but all evidence i have now points to safari's unzipping as the problem.
