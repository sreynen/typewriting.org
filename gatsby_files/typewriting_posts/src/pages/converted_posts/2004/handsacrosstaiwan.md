title: "hands across taiwan" 
---
<p>ever since spending my first day in taiwan, i've found myself trying to counter the myth that taiwan is basically the same country as china. i don't know or care enough about the political issues to be declaring who is "right" - i suspect no one is - but a single day in taiwan should make it clear that it doesn't matter. taiwan is culturally distinct from china. older taiwanese resent china, and younger taiwanese don't even realize they share an ancestry with the chinese, causing a form of racism that seems absolutely absurd to the outside observer. anyway, i'm happy i no longer need to make these more complex observations, and can now simply point to the fact that <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/3495546.stm">one million (that's about one in every twenty three) taiwanese held hands across the entire country in a show of support for taiwan as a sovereign country</a>. regardless of the political reality, taiwanese people clearly believe they are not part of china, and no amount of political posturing is going to change that.</p>
