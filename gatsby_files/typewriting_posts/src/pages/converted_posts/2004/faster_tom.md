<p>some people - okay, one person - had pointed out that my <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/language/virtual_tom_coates.php">virtual tom coates</a> script tended to time out in it's attempt to spit out twenty words. i've made some improvements, and now it can spit out <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/language/virtual_tom_coates.php?words=1000">hundreds of words without timing out</a>. it still has a lot of room for improvement, but even if i can't make it any better, i should still be able to make a 50,000 word novel by the end of the month.</p>
