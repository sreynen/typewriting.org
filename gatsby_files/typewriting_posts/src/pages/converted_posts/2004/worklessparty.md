i was up in chicago on march 20 at the big anti-war protest. there were a lot of different people handing out different socialist newspapers, and when i was offered the fifth or six different socialist newspaper, i asked the person "why are there so many different socialist newspapers?" that person was <a href="http://www.socialistalternative.org/justice30/7.html">stephen edwards, president of AFSCME local 2858 and proponent of a workers' party in illinois</a>. today i read a <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/32084">metafilter thread</a> about <a href="http://www.worklessparty.org/">the work less party of vancouver</a>. rather than "workers of the world unite" it's "workers of the world relax". they've got good slogans, but i'm still waiting on the newspaper.
