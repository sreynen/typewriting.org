title: "the war i might support" 
---
<p>i've been getting gradually less anti-war over the past two years, but i haven't yet supported any war. i watched a video last night from <a href="http://democracynow.org/">democracy now</a>, in which it was casually mentioned that civilians always suffer the most deaths in war. if that's true, i might never support a war. but i'm not sure that's true. anyway, the war i think i'm most likely to support is one against north korea. the government of north korea has now combined all of the negative features of communism (which from all historic evidence is inevitably totalitarian) with <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/this_world/3440771.stm">the worst of the nazis</a>. short of photographic evidence of dealing directly with the devil, i can't imagine how they could make themselves a better candidate for war with america.</p>
