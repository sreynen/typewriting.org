<p>i just came back from an interview with <a href="http://www.envisionamerica.com/">en-vision america</a>, a local company i'd never heard of before seeing a help wanted ad in the local paper for someone to do database work.  it's hard to tell what my chances are of getting the job because i was the first person they interviewed, and the job description is rather vague (a little of everything).  but whether or not i get the job, it's a cool company.  they make product identifiers for blind people.  currently they have two products: one scans bar codes and the other reads <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFID">RFID</a> chips. both use text-to-speech to read product descriptions to users, ranging in detail from a simple product name to more information like cooking instructions for food or prescription details.</p>
