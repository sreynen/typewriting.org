<p>i <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2004-08-12&amp;title=firefox+problems%3A+ugh">previously</a> wrote about the multi-search functionality in firefox, and how it doesn't allow the full range of searches it could. this, along with a few other annoyances, caused me to continue using safari. unfortunately, safari doesn't have multi-search functionality. enter <a href="http://www.pozytron.com/?acidsearch">acidsearch</a>, a free plugin that gives safari multi-search functionality and even allows for more searches than firefox. for example, i was able to make <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/geek/acidsearch/php.net.plist">a search component for php.net</a>, which is impossible in firefox.</p>
