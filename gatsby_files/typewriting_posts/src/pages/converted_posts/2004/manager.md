<p>imagine you own a store, and you hire a new manager for your store. in his first month of managing the store, the store is robbed and an employee is shot. the police say the robber is known to live on the north side of town, but the manager spends half of the store's monthly income to hire a private investigator  to find the robber on the south side of town. he has to fire another employee to pay for this. nobody is coming to your store anymore.</p><br><p>you don't think the manager is doing a good job, but you're busy with another store you own for the next month, so you don't have time to do interviews for a new manager. one of the remaining employees offers to do the job, but the current manager says this employee just wants to steal the remaining store funds.</p><br><p>who do you want to manage your store for the next month: the currrent manager or the employee?</p>
