for those who don't know, ebay owns paypal now, allowing me to do two rants in one and appear to be one the same topic.<br>first: why doesn't ebay just embrace fake ads? people are always selling things like "iraq" on ebay, which goes against their terms of service. why don't they make a special submission form for fake ads and not take bids (or take bids, but don't follow up with payment requests) on such ads. that would provide a cheap way to draw in users, and it would remove any confusion for those people who don't get the jokes.<br>second: why does paypal allow me to make a transaction drawing funds from a bank account that has been closed for months? i thought i was drawing funds from my credit card. i suspect this is going to cost me three or four times the transaction amount to deal with this.
