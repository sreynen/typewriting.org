<p><a href="http://inessential.com/?comments=1&amp;postid=2766">brent simmons</a> asked <q>What new web services would you like to see?</q> rogers cadenhead answered <q>one Web service I'd like to see in every newsreader is the ability to filter an incoming feed</q>. i've been doing this locally through a PHP script for a few months. now that i realize someone else might be interested in doing this, i've posted my <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/rssfilter.php">RSS filter</a> for all to use. if you've ever thought 'i wish i could filter my RSS', you'll find this handy. if you've never thought that, you'll probably wonder what i'm talking about.</p>
