anyone can now <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/user/register.php">register for a user account</a> on randomchaos.com. after you register, you can <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/user/profile.php">create a profile</a>, which currently consists of a first and last name. once you've done that, whenever you're on a page with comments (and logged in), your name will already be in the comment form. this is a step towards a re-vamp of <a href="http://randomchaos.com/games/reversi/">the reversi game</a> which will allow registered users to play each other.
