title: "'any democrat' leads polling"

<p>before the democratic primaries were clearly over, polls were being run pitting bush against "any democrat". <a href="http://www.zogby.com/news/ReadNews.dbm?ID=728">"any democrat" did fairly well in this polling</a>. back then, dean was the favored candidate, and <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2003-12-07">i suggested his opponents might want to change their names to "anyone but bush."</a> sadly, nobody took my advice.</p><br><p>today, <a href="http://www.salon.com/politics/war_room/2004/05/25/polls/">salon reports some poll numbers</a>: <q>The race for the White House remains tied, with Kerry at 49 percent and Bush at 47% among likely voters. More Americans disapprove (49%) than approve (47%) of the president's job performance.</q> the poll numbers of kerry and bush are identical to the disapproval and approval ratings of bush. those who disapprove of bush will vote for kerry. and those who approve of bush will, of course, vote for bush. i'd really like to see a poll showing how many people (or better yet voters) don't like kerry but will vote for him anyway. right now kerry is leading polling almost entirely as an "any democrat" or "anyone but bush" candidate. no one cares what he says or does (or doesn't say or do). just as long as he's not bush, 49% will vote for him. go "any democrat"!</p>
