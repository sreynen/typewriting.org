brad kagawa says <a href="http://haacked.com/archive/2004/08/30/987.aspx">a sign</a> reading "&lt;/BUSH&gt;" is <q>the geekiest protest sign he's ever seen</q>. but that's not valid XHTML, and everyone knows real geeks use XHTML.  clearly some work is needed in encouraging use of modern web standards in protest sign markup. maybe a job for the <a href="http://webstandards.org/">web standards project</a>?
