<p>a friend of mine who visited europe was telling some americans about the trip and was asked: "are there a lot of african americans in europe?" if the ridiculousness of that question isn't imediately apparent (and it took me a while), you're likely a fellow american. i was remembering this question as i read <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2004/EDUCATION/01/22/king.controversy.ap/index.html">a CNN article</a> about a school punishing a south african student for campaigning for the school's "distinguished african american student award."
