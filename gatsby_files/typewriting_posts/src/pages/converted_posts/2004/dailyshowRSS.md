a quick google search for an RSS feed of <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/mp/browse.php?s=ds">the daily show clips comedy central offers</a> turned up nothing. this surprised me, because i regularly see references to these daily show clips around the weblog world. i don't have a television, so this is an important source of entertainment for me. today i finally got tired of checking the website every day, and decided to make an <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/dailyshow.php">RSS feed of the daily show clips</a>.
