tired of a partisan executive branch? vote bush-edwards. <a href="http://www.electoral-vote.com/aug/aug11.html">electoral-vote.com says</a>: <q>Thus if the electoral college is tied and the House votes, Bush wins. However, all is not lost for the Democrats. The Senate picks the Vice President, so if the Democrats pick up the two seats needed to recapture the Senate, we get a hybrid administration: Bush-Edwards.</q> that  would be interesting.
