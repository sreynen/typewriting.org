<a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/comment.php">the comment page</a> now has an RSS feed of the most recent comments, so i get notification every time someone posts a comment. i suspect no one else will want to use this just yet, but i hope to have topical comment feeds eventually, so you can post a comment to something, then subscribe to the feed, and get notified if anyone responds.
