title: "PHP array loops: use while"

<p>in PHP there are three control structures that could be used to loop through arrays: <a href="http://php.net/for">for</a>, <a href="http://php.net/foreach">foreach</a>, and <a href="http://php.net/while">while</a>. foreach was made for looping through arrays, so it has long been my first choice among these three. last week i posted a code sample in response to a question on an email list, and someone responded:</p><br><blockquote>This looks very useful--but one performance-related note. I've just finished doing a fairly heavy performance optimization review of a Web app at work, and it's amazing how expensive foreach () in PHP is compared to while...</blockquote><br><p>i thought this was just someone with way too much interest in optimization until i ran <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/geek/loops.php">some PHP array loop speed tests</a> today. foreach is actually slightly faster than for, which didn't surprise me. what did surprise me is how much faster while is than foreach: on my local mac, while is 15,000 times faster. that means you could run up to 15,000 while loops in the time it would take to run through one foreach loop. on my server (which is both optimized and a newer version of PHP), while is only 3,000 times faster, which is still a huge difference. so i'll probably never use foreach again for anything in which speed is even a slight concern.</p>
