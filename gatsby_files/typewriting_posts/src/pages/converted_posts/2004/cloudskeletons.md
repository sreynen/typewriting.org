title: "cloud skeletons"

<p>sometimes i close my eyes at night and see what i can best describe as cloud skeletons. imagine a circle, and then imagine the inverse of that circle, which would look something like a cross, only a bit more arched. now imagine the same thing with a cloud. and now the same thing with a bunch of clouds. the inverse clouds - the cloud skeletons - make new clouds, which then fade into their own skeletons, and this cycle continues. this is the closest thing to a recurring nightmare i can remember having, but it happens when i'm still awake. then i open my eyes for a bit before trying to sleep again. eventually the cloud skeletons go away.</p>
