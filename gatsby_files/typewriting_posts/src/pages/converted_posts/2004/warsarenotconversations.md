okay, so <a href="http://www.cluetrain.com/#95theses">markets are conversations</a>. and <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2003/10/07#politicsAreConverationsToo">politics are conversations too</a>. but <a href="http://doc.weblogs.com/2004/07/10#warsAreConversations">wars</a>? wars are not conversations. conversations involve multiple parties talking and listening.  this happens in functional markets.  this happens (though less often) in functional politics. this does not happen in wars. no one listens in a war. wars are shouting matches. when a market or conversation is over, you've gained something (money, goods, services, information).  when a war or shouting match is over, you've lost something (time, money, life).
