i've never used moveable type, so i'm not in the market for a new publishing system, but it seems like all the <a href="http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2004/05/13/for-those-about-to-move-to-wordpress-or-textpattern/">cool</a> <a href="http://diveintomark.org/archives/2004/05/14/freedom-0">kids</a> are headed over to <a href="http://www.wordpress.org/">wordpress</a> because of <a href="http://www.sixapart.com/log/2004/05/movable_type_30.shtml">moveable type's new terms</a>. brad sucks gives some more information about wordpress, which may be another reason to move to wordpress, or it may be a reason not to, depending on how paranoid you are: <a href="http://www.bradsucks.net/archives/000483.php">they know who you are</a>.
