i don't buy a lot of software. i rely mostly on what was on my computer when i bought it and what i can find for free. one of the free applications i've been using for a long time is <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">netnetswire lite</a>. it's the free version of <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/">netnewswire</a>, but it's a fully usable application with no nags to upgrade to the paid version. that's one of the main reasons i upgraded to the paid version today.<br>i had been meaning to do that for a while, but i finally did it today because of the recent release of netnewswire 2. among the <a href="http://ranchero.com/netnewswire/whatsnew/netnewswire20.php">new features</a> in version 2 is an embedded browser. i expected this to be nice, but i didn't realize how nice. it's so nice that i don't need safari anymore. so i'm also switching to <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/">firefox</a> now.<br>as <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2004-08-12&amp;title=firefox+problems%3A+ugh">i've said before</a>, one of the main things i don't like about firefox is the ugliness of form elements. but because netnewwire's embedded browser using the same display engine as safari, i can use that when i want things to be more pretty, and use firefox when i want things to be more functional (e.g. use <a href="http://delicious.mozdev.org/">the del.icio.us extension</a>).<br>only one major roadblock remains in my quest for a better browsing experience: the daily show. i watch <a href="http://www.comedycentral.com/mp/browsevideos.php?s=ds">the daily show clips</a> often, but their website staff seems to be searching for the worst video format available. they originally had real video, but that wasn't bad enough, so now they use windows media. believe it or not, microsoft isn't especially quick to develop plugins for firefox on macs.<br>there is no windows media extension that works on mac os x. safari would at least prompt me to open the files in windows media player, but firefox just says it can't find a plugin, leaving me to either sift through multiple pages of source code searching for the actual file address, or open safari just to have safari open windows media player. i'll probably do the latter until i write a script to do the former for me.
