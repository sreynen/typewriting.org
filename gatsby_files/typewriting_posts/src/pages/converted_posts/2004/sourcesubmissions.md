<p><a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/statistics.php">the statistics page</a> is rather buggy right now, but it shows <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/source.php">the source page</a> as among the most accessed on randomchaos.com.  i have no idea who is viewing the source, but now these people can submit changes back to me. i'll review and implement the changes i like (and give credit to submitters). this makes the website much more like a regular open source project, but whether or not anyone participates remains to be seen. the new format also makes it easier to take the code and use it elsewhere. maybe i'll eventually add a downloadable file option. or maybe someone else will.</p>
