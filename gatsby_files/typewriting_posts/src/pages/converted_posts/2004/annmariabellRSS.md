<p>i first got to know ann by suggesting that she get an RSS feed for <a href="http://annmariabell.com/alternate/blog/blog.html">her weblog</a>. she writes her weblog by hand, so i didn't think my standard screen-scraping solution would work very well. but she has generally standard HTML. so until she changes formatting, my new screen-scraped <a href="http://annmariabell.com/alternate/blog/blog.html">ann maria bell RSS feed</a> should work.</p>
