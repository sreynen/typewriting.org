<a href="http://www.lehigh.edu/~jamr/">josh</a> occassionally sends me <a href="http://www.toothpastefordinner.com/">toothpaste for dinner</a> URLs, which are always funny, but it's just so much work to visit a site every day to get the new funniness. so i made <a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/toothpastefordinner.php">an RSS feed of toothpaste for dinner</a>. then i thought "i wonder if someone else has already done this..." which a wiser coder would have thought before starting, because as it turns out <a href="http://myrss.com/f/t/o/toothpastefordinnerHw3h5p1.html">two</a> <a href="http://www.kafsemo.org/rss/filters/">people</a> already have. but mine includes the full content, and the others don't. so enjoy the funniness delivered to your RSS reader.
