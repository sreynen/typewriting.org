a few weeks ago, i wrote in "<a href="http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2003-12-30&amp;title=vote+in+your+own+country">vote in your own country</a>": <q>do whatever else you want to push your political agenda.</q> <a href="http://www.theworldvotes.org/">the world votes</a> is a new website that is taking a non-binding international vote on the upcoming US election. i think this is a fine idea, because it's only an indirect influence on the actual election. however, i don't expect this will do a very good job of representing the world's opinion on the US election, as it is limited to those with internet access (which most people don't have). judging by the registration numbers, it would be better titled "europe votes".
