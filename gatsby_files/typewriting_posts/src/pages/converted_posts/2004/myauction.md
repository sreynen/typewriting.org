<p>i'm auctioning off all the hardware i can no longer convince myself i'll someday make useful. for a limited time only, you can get <a href="http://cgi.ebay.com/ws/eBayISAPI.dll?ViewItem&amp;item=4134151224">a fully functional unix workstation for 5 cents</a> (plus shipping). i hope someone bids on this. i hate to see something as geeky as a next station go to waste.</p>
