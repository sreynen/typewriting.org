<p>i'm watching CSI episodes on DVD and one character just said "scent triggers memory more accutely than any of the five senses." this caught my attention because i have a poor sense of smell (anosmia) and a poor long term memory. a while back, <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2003/02/on_people_who_cant_smell.shtml">tom coates, who also has anosmia, clued me in to information about anosmia with an essay on the topic</a>. from the comments, he seems to have helped quite a few people with anosmia down a path of discovery about the problem. i'd be interested to hear how many of these people have poor long term memory as well.</p>
