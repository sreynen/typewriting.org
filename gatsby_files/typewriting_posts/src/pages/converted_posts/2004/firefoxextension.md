<p>i made <a href="http://www.randomchaos.com/software/firefox/">my first firefox hack</a>. it's incredibly simple and i'm sure i spent more than an hour on it. but i learned an important lesson: stuffit unzips files into folders that weren't there when the files were zipped. important to me, anyway.</p>
