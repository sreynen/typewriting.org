<p><a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3546007.stm">a BBC article on STD rates in america</a> suggests that either virgins are somehow getting sexually transmitted diseases just as often as non-virgins (hard to imagine how that could happen), or kids (and particularly christian kids) are betraying their pledges of virginity. i'm not surprised that STDs exist among pledged virgins, but the apparent rates *are* surprising.</p>
