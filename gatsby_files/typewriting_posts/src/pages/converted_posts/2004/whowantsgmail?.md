<p>so i have some <a href="http://gmail.google.com/">gmail</a> invitations, and i'm following <a href="http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2004/06/anyone_for_gmail.shtml">tom's condition of how i must distribute them</a> (lest i be considered a person without honour): if you say something funny before i run out, i'll give you one. and i'm going to go ahead a make that a viral condition: you have to do the same with some of the invitations you get on gmail, including passing on the condition. now be funny.</p>
