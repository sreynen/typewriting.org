<p>if you find <a href="http://tinyurl.com/">tiny URLs</a> annoying, you'll be doubly annoyed when everyone starts using <a href="http://www.hugeurl.com/">huge URLs</a>. not only do they not tell you where you're going, but they also take up ridiculous amounts of space for no reason. what a wonderful place this internet is where even the worst ideas can thrive.</p>
