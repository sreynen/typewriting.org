in physical space is far from simple (and also far from perfect). we use a complex system of clues such as dress, posture, location (dark alley vs. library), association (\"hey, do you know that

responded</a> to <a href=\"http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2002-11-29&amp;title=manufacture+scarcity+or+wait\">my post on manufacturing scarcity</a>. he writes <q>All around us are products and services dripping with usability decisions based around making certain uses easy <i>by</i> making others harder...</q> he\'s right. first, i should perhaps clarify that i have no problem with making it more difficult to do things that are (or are almost) universally agreed to be bad. spam certainly falls into this category, as does acidental house fires. also, i meant to use the word \"difficulty\" in a general sense. it\'s not always bad to create difficulty. it <em>is</em>, however, always bad to create more difficulty than ease. or, to quote the text linked to from this questionable text, <q>it is best to take actions which create the most ease and the least difficulty</q>. at the end of the day (or the week, or the month, or whenever you consider the work done), what you did should not have made people\'s lives more difficult than they were when you began. i\'m guessing tom and i are in agreement here.</p>\r\n<p>it\'s not clear to me that a paid email system would create more difficulty than ease. but it seems clear to me that there are other ways of solving the spam problem, and these ways couldn\'t possibly get a fair trial after somebody has a self-interest in maintaining a paid system. the radio or oil industries provide ready examples of this problem. i am assuming tom\'s solution would require the creation of this type of self-interest because i can\'t imagine how it could work otherwise.</p>\r\n<p>tom sticks to his main point: <q>an identity should be an <i>effort</i> to use.</q> i think i understand his point here, but i don\'t believe it. i don\'t personally care much about the ability to maintain mutliple or identities or anonymity, but i can easily imagine how other people might. people in modern china (or even in a future america where the government has been granted broad control of its citizens) may have a valid desire to maintain anonymity online that is clearly more important than my annoyance with spam.</p>\r\n<p>tom\'s example moves the question away from an internet-wide context to a site-specific context, but every network built on top of the internet inherits some features of the internet. tom misses one important step between the person establishing the identity and the website. he makes an assumption of questionable possibility - <q>that only one user can be logged into the site from that computer at any one time</q> - but he must also be making the assumption that the website knows from what computer the login request is originating. this is the step that the internet makes impossible by not preventing computers from posing as other computers. i\'m posting this message under my website identity as administrator of this domain, from an ip address which maps to my computer in taiwan. but for all my website knows, this message could be a copy of a message created by a spammer in new jersey, which my computer recieved and passed on as if i had typed it (after i went through a one-hour login process - or maybe just recieved the password of such process from another computer in california). i don\'t see how tom\'s example system could prevent a user from sitting at a single computer all day creating identities and then passing those identities around to other computers -- assuming it can even prevent a computer from doing the same.</p>','2002-12-05 22:59:05'),(151,'domains after death','<p>i once had plans to make my domain (randomchaos.com) into a public resource. except for administrative tasks, i designed every tool i wanted as a tool that anyone could use. with the latest redesign i gave up on that idea; now i\'m just designing tools for myself. on the other hand, the source is more easily available now, so if anyone wants to use these tools, they can make their own local copies of them. it wasn\'t any shift in ideology that prompted this shift in audience. i just realized that no one else wants the tools i\'m making. as an unexpected benefit, narrowing my audience has proved to significantly speed development.</p>\r\n<p>so now my domain is becoming increasingly a reflection of myself. a lot of domain owners, and especially webloggers, have very \"personal\" domains -- not in the sense that they necessarily share intimate details on their websites, but rather in the sense that they personally produce the majority of the content therein. so what happens when the owner of a personal domain dies? i haven\'t seen this happen yet on any of the personal sites i frequent, but domain owners (like all people) are always getting older.</p>\r\n<p>i only see a few options here, and they all have major drawbacks. first, the personal site could remain unchanged upon the death of its owner. it could become a sort of memorial to the person who created it. this strikes me as a little ego-centric, resting on the assumption that whatever one has created in a website is so important that it should remain as a fixed entity in an otherwise rapidly changing internet. it\'s almost like preserving the rooms people lived in after their deaths. the second option is inheritence. a close friend of the deceased could take over the website. this also doesn\'t work well because no one else is really going to be able to continue a personal website. that\'s what makes it personal, after all. the last option i see is to let the website pass away with its creator. the problem with this is that anyone else could snatch up the domain name and abuse the continued inflow of visitors. this would be analogous to someone buying your house after you die and turning into a (most likely porn) store. only people keep dropping by to see you months or years after, and -- for those domains that include the name of their owner (e.g. diveintomark.org, curry.com) -- your name is left on the mailbox.</p>\r\n<p>unfortunately, this doesn\'t really matter for me because 1) i\'m not getting visitors in significant numbers, and 2) this isn\'t scottreynen.org. but i wonder if the people who do have popular personal websites have ever even thought about this. with all of the effort put into these websites, and all of the potential pitfalls, has anyone thought about it enough to give specific instructions to friends or family? or to include a domain in a will?</p>','2002-12-05 23:18:06'),(152,'optional

Last week, however, the\r\nadministration said it would let the machines continue to rumble through the parks. What gives? Public comments have carried increasingly less weight since a 1987 court ruling that gave officials permission to ignore mass mailings, such as the one generated when green advocacy encouraged their members to sign form letters about the snowmobiles. Accordingly, the administration also discarded 93 percent of the comments it received about its plans to roll back protections for roadless areas in national forests, arguing that only 7 percent of the comments were \"original\" and not the result of a\r\nBeltway-orchestrated campaign. </i></blockquote>','2002-12-11 21:52:21'),(172,'the ebb of irony','<p>it appears <a href=\"http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2002-11-29&amp;title=the+painful+irony\">the flood of irony</a> has reached a high tide, and finally begun to ebb. <a href=\"http://www.voanews.com/article.cfm?objectID=42E52739-4309-4962-A65AF109738F3E77\">voice of america</a> reports: \"Henry Kissinger stepped down Friday as chairman of a panel investigating last year\'s New York and Washington terrorist attacks.\" apparently there was speculation that there might be a conflict-of-interest with kissinger\'s consulting firm. still, the press hasn\'t pointed out the obvious conflict-of-interest regarding <a href=\"http://www.fair.org/activism/kissinger-crimes.html\">kissinger\'s crimes against humanity</a>.</p>','2002-12-14 11:54:24'),(173,'piracy is progressive taxation','<p><a href=\"http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2002/12/11/piracy.html\">tim o\'reilly</a>, publisher, writes \"being well-enough known to be pirated would be a crowning achievement.

href=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/001157.htm\">weblogs</a> suggesting that william hannas is an idiot, i wanted to find out exactly what he said that was so idiotic. unfortunately, the article that sparked the fire is \"temporarily unavailable\". the closest i could come to hannas\' point was <a href=\"http://www.emptybottle.org/glass/2003/05/ignorance_bought_and_paid_for.php\">this post by one wonderchicken</a>, which says that the new york times says that hannas says: <q>Asian science has suffered because the main Asian languages are written in \"character-based rather than alphabetic\" systems</q>. hannas is then quoted as saying we <q>now recognize that the writing systems of East Asia, including Chinese, Japanese and Korean, are \"syllabaries,\"</q> which is what he is then attacked for.</p>\r\n<p>i don\'t get it. these two ideas, both attributed to hannas, seem to contradict each other. certainly hannas is an idiot if he thinks chinese is a phonetic written language. and he may be wrong if he says that character-based writing prevents people from thinking innovatively. i\'m not sure what the direct relationship is between languages and the level of innovation in asia (or even what that level is). but having lived in japan, and working with children in taiwan, it seems to me the indirect effects of the language on the education systems certainly discourage innovative thinking.</p>\r\n<p>this isn\'t as true in japan, where the pictographic writing system isn\'t the only way to read, but in taiwan (and china), children spend hours upon hours copying characters to learn how to write. they no only spend more time per day learning writing (and i suspect also reading), they continue to learn to write through a higher age than their english (and i suspect generally phonetic language) speaking counterparts. if nothing else, this is time that could be otherwise spent practicing creative thinking if the chinese phonetic alphabet were used more widely. now it is used only as a stepping stone toward learning how to read non-phonetic chinese characters.</p>\r\n<p>another consideration related to the time issue is that the age of entry into writing is higher for chinese students. writing is an important means of clarifying thoughts. unfortunately, by the time chinese students have learned enough characters to write down their thoughts, they\'ve already learned to think less creatively.</p>\r\n<p>when i learned to write english, i did so by repeatedly running my pencil over patterns until i had physically memorized the motion of each letter. for 26 letters, that\'s not a huge investment in memorization-style learning. the chinese language (at least in taiwan) is taught in basically the same way. but instead of 26 characters, chinese has over 10,000. that <em>is</em> a huge investment in memorization-style learning. even if this were the only memorization chinese students did in school, their minds would be trained to memorize. but because the teachers spend so much time teaching language through memorization, it\'s only natural that they use similar (memorization-based) means of teaching other subjects.</p>\r\n<p>i teach at what is probably one of the most americanized english cram schools in taiwan (if not also china), and my students still learn english mostly through memorization. why? because that\'s what they\'re good at. eight year old chinese students can memorize english almost as fast as i can. but trying to get the same students to think creatively is often a lost cause. i\'ve heard stories about chinese graduate students who found it easier to write entire essays and memorize them before an exam rather than retain the ideas and organize them during the test. memorization not only doesn\'t end when language study ends; it doesn\'t end when students leave chinese school, or even when they leave asia.</p>\r\n<p>maybe there\'s a more creative way to teach chinese writing. if not, creative thinking could certainly be encouraged more in other subjects. but right now it\'s not. if we\'re accepting the assertion that asian people don\'t innovate as much, the cause isn\'t hard to determine. people learn how to learn in the education system.</p>','2003-05-12 22:04:24'),(279,'no-host trackback','<p>i just sent my first <a

match our (desired) reality.</p>\r\n<p>that\'s great, but have you ever tried to make a new word? i have, and it\'s no trivial task. for me, this issue always comes up in political groups i\'m involved in. a peacenik group or a gay rights organization exists because its members have an idea of a world they think would be slightly better than our current reality (e.g. a world with peace, or without hate). the challenge of describing such a world can be incredibly frustrating. so often the ideas are there, but the language is not. in the end, the hours spent arguing over the merits of words like \"homophobia\" or \"heterosexism\" or \"hir\" mean very little. the larger culture adopts whatever language is wants without first consulting affected peoples.</p>\r\n<p>but the larger culture generally chooses from words that were, in fact, created by a smaller group, and ultimately, an individual. so while an individual has next to no control over the culture\'s use of language, one can still, maybe like a parent, provide options and hope the culture chooses a good word. but coming up with a good word is very hard - much harder than moving to a new house, or even adding a room to an existing house. it\'s something that often takes a large group and a lot of time. it\'s also something that can take you somewhere new. something more like road construction. which means language is the road. i like that metaphor much better than the house. we don\'t sit inside language; we move through it. if it won\'t take us to where we want to go, we have to stop everything and

unfortunate thing, or anything but good. it\'s a common idea that robots or computers are going to take our jobs, this will be the cause of huge problems throughout the world. worse than the great depression.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://marshallbrain.com/robotic-nation.htm\">marshall brain\'s robotic nation essay</a> is a prime example. it concludes: <q>The arrival of humanoid robots should be a cause for celebration. With the robots doing most of the work, it should be possible for everyone to go on perpetual vacation. Instead, robots will displace millions of employees, leaving them unable to find work and therefore destitute.</q>. you can read the whole essay, but that\'s probably enough to give you the basic idea i\'m trying to refute here. my argument goes something like this: we don\'t need jobs. we only need jobs today to get us things we really need, like food, shelter, and clothing. before they are able to replace us in all other jobs, robots will be able to provide us with food, shelter, and clothing, at which point the loss of jobs will not be a problem.</p>\r\n<p>we don\'t need jobs. no one will die from lack of employment. some of us enjoy working. some of us don\'t. there\'s no way for anyone to prevent anyone else from working. if mcdonalds fires everyone and replaces them with robots, that doesn\'t prevent you from starting your own restaurant and serving food to people. if you want to work, you\'ll always be able to work. if you don\'t want to work, unemployment isn\'t a problem.</p>\r\n<p>people complain about unemployment, but lack of work isn\'t what really bothers anyone. it\'s lack of money from work. that\'s why the US government is sending out checks to millions of americans rather than giving everyone a job. people don\'t care about being unemployed if they have money.</p>\r\n<p>and people don\'t really care about money. go give a homeless american a big pile of euro if you don\'t believe me. money only has value if we can spend it on things we really do care about. these things are different for everyone, but one common item of concern is food. many people don\'t realize that <a href=\"http://www.consumeralert.org/issues/subsidy/farmbr.htm\">the US government has paid american farmers to not grow food</a>. they do this because if too much of a given food is grown, the supply becomes so high that the price drops very low. extremely low prices seem like a good thing, but has some negative consequences in the long run, such as destroying the entire market for a particular crop by removing profit motivation from farmers.</p>\r\n<p>in a future world in which robots are doing most or all of the farming, compensation of suppliers is no longer an important factor (robots don\'t get paid), and the food economy becomes entirely driven by demand. a government would have no reason to not provide a welfare net of food, at least, for all citizens, as the cost would be minimal and the demand would be high. the same is true of other common needs, like shelter and clothing, though less so than of food.</p>\r\n<p>so what will all these unemployed people do? whatever they want, but there is good reason to believe it will be less manual labor and more intellectual work. throughout history the primary sector of work has shifted from agriculture to industry to service. (see <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0130835781/\"><cite>continuity and change in world politics</cite></a>) that\'s a steady shift over time away from manual labor and toward intellectual labor. this isn\'t a shift in job interests, but an increase in automation that allows more people to do easier jobs. that\'s right - robots.</p>\r\n<p>automation will significantly change the structure of our economy, and those unable to change with the times, like always, we be hurt in the process. but this is not a new phenomenon. this economic shift has been taking place since the dawn of civilization. we need only compare our modern lives with those of people a few hundred years ago to determine whether automation is generally positive or negative. i believe it\'s positive, and thus, robots are cool.</p>','2003-08-03 09:48:16'),(344,'mind-control cheese','<p>tom coates has <a href=\"http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2003/08/on_the_existence_of_god.shtml\">an interesting piece about his atheist views</a>. my favorite part is in the comments, where he defends his atheism against agnostics:</p>\r\n<blockquote>I simply refuse to accept that there\'s anything distinct and different about \"God\" that makes it different at a conceptual level from Mind-Control Cheese from Denver - ie. it\'s basically ridiculous.

You can\'t do the RDF experiment until there are interesting amounts of metadata floating around. But if we say that all metadata that can benefit from RDF must first be expressed in RDF, it\'s kind of a non-starter.</blockquote>\r\n<p>that was my initial thinking when i said in jon\'s comments that this will all be worthless if someone doesn\'t build the applications to read this metadata. but i\'ve since changed my mind. RDF can encode metadata in a variety of ways such that  we can selectively choose which data will be visible to an application unaware of the metadata. this means that a user of a standard RSS reader shouldn\'t even notice if i start sticking metadata into my RSS feed, either as descriptions of existing text, or as additional information.</p>\r\n<p>so here\'s the plan for me: 1) design a feed that looks pretty much like the existing RSS job feed until you look at the source, and then you\'ll see that the job information is all marked up with RDF. 2) write myself an XML-based resume. 3) design an application to filter the RSS/RDF job feed down to jobs that match (in some yet to be determined way) the data in my resume. 4) ??? 5) get a job.</p>','2003-08-07 07:35:43'),(352,'website

theoretically possible, but it breaks the feed in netnewswire lite. so i\'m going to leave the information outside of the description, which means that i\'ll have duplicate content, both in the description and in the metadata. unfortunate, but still usable.</p>\r\n<p>while attempting to include as much metadata as possible, i came up with what i think is a nifty hack. for companies that don\'t provide links to their websites, i\'m using google\'s auto-forwarding feature to do a search for the company name and send the user on to the first result. because the company names are generally a few words long, and because most companies have websites, the first result has a pretty high likelihood of being the company website.</p>','2003-08-07 12:37:22'),(353,'google news alert +

miles, i spent far too long. this gave me time to reflect about some of what i\'ve been reading in weblogging circles these days. <a href=\"http://info.astrian.net/jargon/terms/f/flame.html\">flaming</a> isn\'t a new phenomenon, but it seems to have moved closer to the fore since the <a href=\"http://www.intertwingly.net/wiki/pie/FrontPage\">the project to build a new syndication format</a> began. all of the more famous webloggers have strong opinions regarding this project, for obvious reasons. and that passion has made it clear, in several instances i won\'t link to, that too many don\'t have a conscious strategy when responding to flames.</p>\r\n<p>yesterday <a href=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/001480.htm\">burning bird discussed the same topic in a post titled \"fight or flight\"</a>, which she concluded: <q>I\'ve thought long about the discussion I was apart of, earlier this week, and one thing that I realized from it is that flight is not an option for me</q>. that was perhaps a foregone conclusion given the false dichotomy of the title. personally, i like to think people are intelligent enough that we can come up with better approaches to our problems than frogs can.</p>\r\n<p>every time i\'m in a traffic jam, i remember <a href=\"http://www.amasci.com/amateur/traffic/traffic1.html\">an article i read five years ago</a> about traffic jams. in it, william beaty used wave physics to come to a zen-like conclusion: <q>A single solitary driver, if they stop \"competing\" and instead adopt some unusual driving habits, can actually wipe away some of the frustrating traffic patterns on a highway.</q> the idea is that while traffic jams generally have an inciting incident, such as an accident, they only continue after that point because of anti-social behavior. \"stop energy\" might be a good name for this behavior. perhaps it\'s just that i was simultaneously thinking of the two topics, but while waiting in the traffic jam, i was struck by the similarities between traffic jams and flaming.</p>\r\n<p>because of the nature of beaty\'s solution to traffic jams, anyone practicing his suggestions won\'t see the results. this uncertainty, and the desire <q>to punish the idiots who will jump into any little space</q> make improving traffic a largely faith-based action. still, it\'s one i personally try to practice because it makes sense to me, and it gives me something to think about while i wait.</p>\r\n<p>waiting, the solution to both traffic jams and flaming, is hard to practice. particularly on the internet, where life seems to have a faster pace (though, of course, the people living it still function at the same speed), it\'s hard to let an idea about which one cares passionately exist without comment. i remember when <a href=\"http://weblognetwork.mindplex.org/2003/08/04.html#a3456\">john robb wrote of a project of mine, <q>this feed sucks</q></a>. my immediate reaction was to post a response in my own weblog. but then i read the rest of the sentence. and i can tell you now, i\'m glad i waited. this is as close as i have come to being involved in a flame war. as a result, what i say here may carry less authority, but just like the traffic jam solution, it makes sense to me.</p>\r\n<p>waiting isn\'t going to work for everyone in all cases, but i think it will decrease \"stop energy\" more effectively than direct response. the two practices are opposite ends of a long spectrum of solutions. in an article in response to what might be called \"flames against buddhist monks\", <a href=\"http://www.abhayagiri.org/fm/v5n3/essay_amaro.htm\">ajahn amaro</a> writes: <q>The Buddha was asked a lot of questions in his time, and he once said there are four ways to respond to a

All other religions were either persecuted or subordinated to the cult of emperor worship.</blockquote>\r\n<p>but buddhists also contributed to the militarist fervor. the book <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0834804050/\">zen at war</a> (which i haven\'t read) provides a detailed account of how zen buddism in particular helped fuel japan\'s advance toward world war two. because of all of this, i was surprised to read <a href=\"http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/2003/08/you_can_put_your_god_over_there.php\">jonathon delacour\'s recent suggestion</a> that <q>Whatever the faults of the Japanese...religious bigotry isn\'t high on the list. </q></p>\r\n<p>while the history of japanese religion contained such religious intolerance, modern japanese religion contains secular tolerance. an <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;safe=off&amp;q=born+shinto+marry+christian+die+buddhist&amp;btnG=Google+Search\">often repeated</a> description of modern japanese religion goes something like this: \"everyone in japan is born shinto, marries christian, and dies buddhist\". you would never see a survey of japanese asking them to pick their \"religion\" because nearly everyone has \"religions\". but this isn\'t really religious tolerance in the sense that japanese buddhists don\'t tolerate japanese shintos. japanese buddhists <em>are</em> japanese shintos. the japanese can\'t really be suggested as an ideal of religious tolerance without also suggesting polytheism as an ideal of religious belief. <a href=\"http://weblog.delacour.net/archives/2003/08/you_can_put_your_god_over_there.php\">jonathon</a> writes of his friend natsuko: <q>She wasn\'t actually saying that the Japanese don\'t have strongly held beliefs since that clearly isn\'t true.</q> if he means beliefs in general, he\'s right; japanese have strongly held beliefs. but i also think it\'s true that japanese (generally) don\'t have strongly held <em>religious</em> beliefs to the extent americans do. for example, it\'s clear that japanese don\'t have christian weddings so often because they strongly believe in the religious significance of a christian wedding. the reason japanese commonly choose christian weddings is that the ritual of a christian wedding is seen as more \"modern\". a wedding signifies something new, whereas birth and death naturally emphasize family roots, so are more commonly performed with traditional (shinto and buddhist) rituals. <a href=\"http://www.thingsasian.com/goto_article/article.2189.html\">an article on \"christian\" weddings in japan</a> (notice the quotation marks around christian) quotes a bride on her decision of wedding style:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"If we had thought about our parents, we would have had a Japanese style ceremony but we are young, we wanted a more casual style,\" said Yuko</blockquote>\r\n<p>i don\'t mean to suggest the rest of the world doesn\'t have a lot to learn from japanese religious views. but if we ever hope to solve the problems of religious intolerance, i  think it\'s important to recognize that they aren\'t unique to america. and for most believers, \"switch to shinto\" isn\'t a solution.</p>','2003-08-31 06:19:40'),(384,'disemployed','<p>my new project, <a href=\"http://www.disemployed.com/\">disemployed</a>, is live for labor day. go <a href=\"http://www.disemployed.com/\">check it out</a> and have a happy labor day.</p>','2003-09-01 11:37:00'),(385,'separation of church and commerce','<p>the discussion of religious fundamentalism continues over on <a href=\"http://akma.disseminary.org/archives/000686.html\">akma\'s weblog</a>, and as i <a href=\"http://weblog.randomchaos.com/index.php?date=2003-08-31&amp;title=japanese+religious+intolerance+and+secular+tolerance\">expected</a>, the christians aren\'t converting to shinto just yet. this whole conversation thread was prompted by some separation of church and state issues. now i\'d like to talk about separation of church and commerce.</p>\r\n<p>yesterday i went to my mother\'s church service, where i watched a light rock concert and part of a hollywood movie. and there were some bible verses in there somewhere as well, but i honestly don\'t remember that part. the last church i visited with my mother had a coffee shop in the lobby. today, i see <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/sections/living/US/christianpopculture030826.html\">an article from abc news about a new cosmo-style bible</a>:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\"People want to lead integrated lives,\" says Mahan [a professor at the Iliff School of Theology]. \"So their entertainment life, their political life and their work life are integrated with their life of faith.\"<br />\r\n...<br />\r\nRevolve and similar efforts typically emphasize aspects of Christianity that might appeal to teenagers\' attitudes.  They describe Jesus as a radical who was not afraid to challenge mainstream society. </blockquote>\r\n<p>the irony here is that the cosmo-bible and screening hollywood movies in church is in no way a challenge to mainstream society. it\'s an attempt to increase the popularity of christianity among youth by <em>imitating</em> mainstream society. as someone raised in the christian church, this strikes me as a sign the church is failing miserably. there is no shortage of engaging content in the new testament. the problem is most of that content is a challenge to the mainstream ethics of consumption that the church has too often adopted. youth are disinterested because they don\'t hear the interesting parts of the biblical story in church. no one is seriously suggesting to american christians that they should love their enemies, give up their privilege, or challenge religious authorities. this is the exciting stuff in the bible, and it\'s stuff that young people would be interested in.</p>\r\n<p>instead the church is mixing commercialism with faith. perhaps this will provide a bridge away from commercialism and toward faith, but i suspect the bridge will lead the other way. if youth are engaged in religion based on eye candy rather than substance of faith, they will leave as soon as the newest eye candy is found elsewhere. people do want to lead integrated lives, but the church should be careful that these lives are integrated with a common base of faith rather than a common base of glossy covers.</p>','2003-09-01 21:30:34'),(386,'because i have ample free time','<p><a href=\"http://doc.weblogs.com/2003/09/03#contentCabinetKey\">doc searls</a> defends weblogs against an (unlinkable) attack by jimmy guterman:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>First, so what if blogs aren\'t mainstream?

href=\"http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2003/10/increasing_transactions_costs_for_email_redux.shtml\">tom did</a>. i still think manufacturing scarcity - for the public, at least - is bad. i\'d rather put up with spam than <a href=\"http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2003/10/13.html#a971\">pay to send email</a>, and i think the introduction of a \"trusted email network\" would practically force all email networks to be \"trusted\". to the extent that \"trusted\" means \"paid\", this is bad. free is not the problem. your neighbor buying herbal viagra is the problem. to the extent that \"trusted\" doesn\'t mean \"paid\", i don\'t see any difference between the trust we currently give an <acronym title=\"SendMail Transfer Protocol\">SMTP</acronym> server and the trust we\'d be giving the new trusted relays. both are just passing the message along, with no understanding of what it contains.</p>\r\n<p>this all reminds me of what <a href=\"http://weblog.randomchaos.com/jessica/\">jessica</a> was telling me about the high school she\'s been working at for the past few weeks. every student at the school has to wear an ID badge at all times. it\'s for security, and while it may seem like overkill, it didn\'t immediately strike me as being utterly ridiculous until jessica told me what one of her students said, which went something like this:</p>\r\n<blockquote>the kids at columbine who shot everyone were students there, so they would have had ID badges. and anyone who has a gun can just hold someone up and take their ID badge, and then they have an ID badge and a gun.</blockquote>\r\n<p>the point being that manufacturity scarcity creates the illusion of security under the assumption that troublemakers can\'t afford the cost of making trouble (in this case, getting a badge - in the case of email, getting a signature from a \"trusted\" server). but this assumption is false. spammers don\'t care about our rules, and they can afford to find and exploit every loophole in the system to work around the system.</p>\r\n<p>they\'ll do the equivalent of holding up a student to get an ID badge, if that\'s what it takes to get into the system. they\'ll pay someone who\'s already in the system to join their ranks. they\'ll find a way. meanwhile, the rest of us will be paying the cost of fooling ourselves.</p>\r\n<p>what doesn\'t get pointed out often enough in these discussions of what to do about spam is that <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/news/business/0,1367,59907,00.html\">too many

hypertext structure by retrieving a document, and recursively retrieving all documents that are referenced.</q> i think the part about retrieving all referenced documents is really beside the point. a web robot is any application that acts as a web browser, but has no human controlling it. if a human is controlling a web browser, a server can send a \"go away\" message and the human (if they are well-behaved) will go away. if there is no human, we need a standardized system for sending \"go away\" messages that the application can understand (and if the application is well-behaved, it will also go away).</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.robotstxt.org/wc/norobots.html\">robots.txt</a> is this format. i\'ve built quite a few web applications that load pages from other servers. and i\'ve done a bit of worrying that one of these web applications would bother the owner of one of the loaded pages. the solution, of course, is to follow the robots.txt standard. by following this standard, i allow the owner of the pages my scripts are loading to say \"go away\" to my applications whenever they chose to do so, and i no longer need to worry about that cease-and-decist letter arriving.</p>\r\n<p>i started looking for something coded in PHP to check robots.txt files, but i found nothing. so i wrote my own. <a href=\"http://www.randomchaos.com/source.php?source=http%3A%2F%2Fweblog.randomchaos.com%2Frobots.inc\">robots.inc</a> contains the function <code>ok_for_robots</code> which will take a URL and tell you if it\'s okay for a robot to load this URL. it will also take an optional name for the robot, but this part isn\'t as widely useful yet because there is no quick way in PHP to specify the name of the application while loading remote content. so the next step is making this easier to do in PHP. meanwhile if you - like me - have PHP scripts that are loading remote pages and you - like me - are concerned about being a good neighbor, you might consider using <a

delacour</a> writes <q>I also enjoy talking about interesting things with not just &#8220;one or two&#8221; but up to <em>three</em> people!</q> last night i attended a meeting with three other people. the meeting went well. the night before, i attended a meeting with six or seven other people. that meeting also went well, but looking back, it occurs to me that it may not have gone so well (from my perspective) had we sat at a round table. as it was conversation generally polarized toward the ends of the long table, in groups of three or four. last week i attended a meeting with about twenty other people, but we split into groups of two or three for a large part of the meeting.</p>\r\n<p>this last meeting was for the <a href=\"http://bncpj.pabn.org/\">bloomington-normal citizens for peace and justice</a>, a local community organization i\'ve been involved in to varying degrees, depending on my geographic distance, since it was founded shortly after september 11, 2001. now that i\'m back in bloomington-normal, i\'m much more actively involved than i was from taiwan or michigan. and i\'ve resumed pushing for more small group time. this pushing played some part in the small group time we had at the last meeting.</p>\r\n<p>prior to today, i would have said that my reason for pushing for small groups is something i read a long time ago in a book about the practice of organization. the book said something like \"meet in groups of six or less\", and i\'ve since been encouraging organizations i\'m involved in to do just that. but it occurs to me now that my interest in that advice and my remembering it for years after are likely strongly tied to being an introvert. were i an extrovert, i might well have read that same passage and discarded the advice in an instant, finding large groups much more conducive to getting work done.</p>\r\n<p>i still think the advice sound, however, even after realizing my own bias toward accepting it. my reasoning now is that any organization is likely to have introverts as members, and i suspect (though i\'m not at all sure) whatever discomfort an extrovert may feel in participating in a small group is significantly less than that an introvert feels in participating in a large group. for the groups i\'m involved in, participation is vital. <a href=\"http://mamamusings.net/archives/2003/03/03/an_extrovert_speaks_quelle_surprise.php\">elizabeth lawley</a> has done some intial explaining of extrovert perspective, but i still have a question for any extroverts out there: do extroverts feel uncomfortable participating in small groups? maybe \"uncomfortable\" is the wrong word even. when i\'m in a large group setting, i don\'t usually feel \"uncomfortable\" participating. i more often feel unable to participate, because the pace of conversation is faster than my ability to solidify my thoughts. do extroverts have a similar (or opposite) sensation in small groups?</p>','2003-11-07 22:43:18'),(431,'google as finder','<p>i\'m <a href=\"http://www.randomchaos.com/document.php?source=nanowrimo\">collecting the daily outputs</a> of the <a

jonathon\'s opinions, as expressed in his weblog. so either i\'m not really \"liberal\", or he\'s not really \"conservative\", or those words aren\'t really important. i strongly suspect the last option.</p>\r\n<p>so along comes <a href=\"http://www.politicalcompass.org/\">the political compass</a>, which explains itself:</p>\r\n<blockquote>The old  one-dimensional categories of  \'right\' and \'left\' , established for the seating arrangement of the French National Assembly of 1789, are overly simplistic for today\'s complex political landscape.</blockquote>\r\n<p>i took the test and ended up a lefty libertarian, which wasn\'t surprising. what was surprising to me was the the political compass itself, specifically it\'s use of \"libertarian\" and \"authoritarian\" as a second axis. i was immediately reminded of seeing <a href=\"http://www.libertarian.org/policy.html\">a strikingly similar political compass at libertarian.org</a>. this site is currently in transition, and seems slightly less influenced by the libertarian party than it was back when i first saw that compass, but as the site points out, it was originally developed by <a href=\"http://www.whittenfamily.com/members/chris/\">chris whitten</a>, a libertarian himself.</p>\r\n<p>while putting \"libertarian\" at the opposite end of the spectrum as \"authoritatian\" is something libertarians like to do, i think it\'s ridiculous. \"authoritarian\" is not the opposite of \"libertarian\". <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=authoritarian\">dictionary.com defines \"authoritarian\"</a> in part as <q>against individual freedom</q>. the problem is that \"libertarian\" means both <q>advocates maximizing individual rights and minimizing the role of the state</q> (as <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=libertarian\">dictionary.com recognizes</a>) and \"member of the libertarian party\". were the word not capitalized at the political compass, the compass may not so strongly imply that anyone not a member of that party is against individual freedom (which is not the same thing as individual rights - another way in which the labeling is inappropriate), but it is capitalized.</p>\r\n<p>we see this problem with the word \"democrat\", which <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=democrat\">dictionary.com properly defines</a> as both <q>An advocate of democracy</q> and <q>A member of the Democratic Party</q>. we commonly show the difference by capitalizing when referring to the party. but imagine if the political compass had \"Democrat\" at one end and \"Authoritarian\" at the other. authoritarians are, after all, against democracy, so this would be reasonable <em>were there not an established political party with that name</em>. but as there is a democratic party, this compass would imply that all republicans are authoritarians, which, current administration aside, is an unfair characterization. that\'s my problem with using \"libertarian\" and \"authoritarian\" as opposite ends of an axis.</p>\r\n<p>i think there\'s a real need for something to move us beyond thinking of politics in terms of \"left\" and \"right\", but i don\'t think the political compass is a solution. rather than adding another axis, i think we need to get rid of the axes altogether. a new axis just doubles the number of ways in which you can be \"with us or against us\". i\'d like to think my agreement with \"conservative\" jonathon or my support of <a

This area, which is often called the \"Sunni triangle,\" is actually more of a quadrilateral whose corners rest on Baghdad in the south, Saddam\'s home city of Tikrit in the north, Ramadi in the west, and Baquba in the east. The Arabic-speaking, Sunni Muslim tribes who predominate in this area received ample largess and many privileges from Saddam, and in turn staffed much of his secret-police and military apparatus. It is in this area that the vast majority of U.S. casualties have occurred. Saddam loyalists, who stand to lose the most from the demise of his regime, have perpetrated almost-daily attacks on U.S. convoys and personnel in this zone. Well-equipped and seemingly generously financed by Saddamist remnants who raided Iraq\'s treasury before fleeing Baghdad, these guerrillas have been waging a low-intensity war that U.S. commanders have been hard-pressed to contain, let alone eliminate.</blockquote>\r\n<p>this passage tells me things i didn\'t know, and it gives me cause to reconsider some of my beliefs about the situation in iraq. it doesn\'t turn me into a conservative, but if such a conversion is possible (i\'ve never met a \"former liberal\" nor a \"former conservative\"), this is a good place to start it. calling me a terrorist is a bad place to start. i\'ve changed my mind on too many issues too many times to believe i\'m currently right about everything i believe, and this is why i seek out people with differing opinions to challenge my own. do you know of any overtly conservative weblogs that don\'t equate liberals with terrorists? if so, please share, because i haven\'t had much luck so far in my

existing words, but also provides a definitive list of which combinations of characters are words and which are not. if i search dictionary.com for a string of letters and no entries are found, i have a fairly good indication that string of letters isn\'t a word. but if i search wiktionary.org for the same string of letters and nothing comes up, i don\'t know if that\'s because it\'s not a word, or

I\'m not talking blogroll links; I\'m talking about links to posts, with associated commentary.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>shelley\'s assumption that the top echelons of weblogging would be come close to representing the broader population stems from a confusion between the majority holding all the influence, and exercising it. the <a href=\"http://www.ndp.ca/mouseland/index.php3?load=mouseland\">parable of mouseland</a> seems appropriate:</p>\r\n<blockquote>All the laws were good laws.

They put in the white cats.</blockquote>\r\n<p>shelley seems to be advocating voting for white cats without questioning why the mice are voting for cats at all. why everyone fills their weblogs with links to the same few people is, i think, a more interesting question than why these few people are men. (the answer to that question is simple: they\'re men because weblogging came from the real world, in which men have long enjoyed priviledge over women.) the gender gap shelley has described is nothing more than one aspect of <a href=\"http://www.shirky.com/writings/powerlaw_weblog.html\">the power law clay shirky described</a>. if women were at the top of the power curve, most links would be to women. women get disproportionately less links in the current system, but so does anyone who is in some way unlike those at the top of the power curve. the top will never be representative of the bottom because it can\'t be. the power curve is a power curve because the top is significantly different than the bottom. if it weren\'t, the curve would be flatter, but it\'s not. shelley\'s \"gender ghetto\" is in no way segregated from the rest of the bottom of this curve, so the real \"ghetto\" is the whole bottom of the curve, which contains about 99% of all webloggers. it\'s not much of a \"ghetto\".</p>\r\n<p>gender doesn\'t strike me as an interesting distinction here, partly because i don\'t believe you can reliably tell someone\'s gender from their writing. <a href=\"http://www.bookblog.net/gender/genie.php\">the gender genie</a> found that i often write \"like a female\", and <a href=\"http://weblog.randomchaos.com/jessica/\">jessica</a> often writes \"like a male\". shelley concludes her piece with <q>I want to be an influence now</q>, but she <em>is</em> an influence now. she\'s just not a power now. she\'s not one of the few people whose links are copied on thousands of other weblogs. but does she really want to be? if we\'re only concerned with concentrating the power in new hands at the top of the power curve, we\'re missing out on the bigger opportunity to flatten the curve by finding ways to turn our influence into networked power at the bottom. because while the power may rest at the top of the power curve right now, the <em>potential</em> power is undoubtedly largest at the bottom. we all use our influence (linking) to increase the concentration of power at the top by turning over our influence to them (if they link to something, we do too), but how could we be using it to create power at the bottom, where it could be much greater? i think this is a much larger and more important question than shelley\'s <q>Women\'s voices have not not been heard as loudly as they should in these areas in the past -- is this same lack of influence now going to be taken into the communication media of the future?</q> but if that\'s a good catalyst to get people interested in the issues of how we could better use our influence, it couldn\'t hurt. i\'d just like to see the issue expanded a bit to include the other 49% of us down here at the bottom of the power curve.</p>','2003-11-14 07:55:01'),(442,'possible diabetic cure','<p>i\'m generally skeptical of much of what\'s newly available for diabetic treatment, such as <a href=\"http://www.caller.com/ccct/local_news/article/0,1641,CCCT_811_2400875,00.html\">implants</a> and <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3089974.stm\">vaccines</a>. but <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/health/3266987.stm\">the bbc today reported the first news that excited me in this area: a possible cure for diabetes</a>.</p>','2003-11-14 12:00:45'),(457,'jeff bezos is now a religion','<p>i was just browsing different meetup topics and noticed that in the middle of <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/browse/rel/\">more conventional religions</a> in the \"religion\" category is a new one: \"jeff bezos\". for those who don\'t know, jeff bezos is the founder and CEO of amazon.com. and now apartently there is a religion dedicated to him. this wouldn\'t surprise me so much if there were also a \"bill gates\" or \"steve jobs\" listing in this category, but jeff bezos currently stands alone as the only technologist who has spawned a religion on meetup.</p>','2003-12-10 09:14:52'),(456,'under-read weblog awards','<p><a href=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/connecting/invisible.htm\">shelley powers</a> has what i think is a wonderful suggestion for a new award:</p>\r\n<blockquote>To be honest, if the Wizbang awards person had taken the nominations, went out to Technorati and found the least linked of them and put them into the award lists, I would have promoted the hell out of it.

href=\"http://www.internationalstudies.ilstu.edu/areastudy/seminar.shtml\">dr. janie leatherman speak on \"engendering peace\"</a>, the recent (and late) arrival of feminist/women\'s studies thinking to the scholastic field of peace and conflict resolution. this field of study, directly concerned with the prevention of war, has long been lacking representation of women. as wars are started and fought primarily by men, the lack of women in peace studies is particularly ironic.</p>\r\n<p>there\'s only so much one can say about a lack of women. dr. leatherman spent most of her lecture talking about where feminist thinking has begun to work into the overall framework of conflict resolution thinking. she described three different approaches to peace theory, only one of which focused on a balance of power between states, such was the \"peace\" we experienced during the cold war. this approach presumes non-intervention in the affairs of another state, and as such isn\'t fertile ground for feminist thinking. dr. leatherman illustrated this point by making the analogy between a genocide campaign within a country\'s own borders and a husband raping his wife. following the logic of non-intervention, nothing should be done to forcibly prevent either activity.</p>\r\n<p>part of the rise in feminist thought within peace studies is due to the rising status of women in larger society. but another part is that the state-focused approach to the field is becoming increasingly irrelevant as states lose their grip on \"the monopoly of violence.\" there was a time when it would take an army to bring down a skyscraper in another country. increasingly, this task can be accomplished not only by international terrorist organizations, but also by organizations such as the WTO, IMF, world bank, UN, EU, and international corporations like mcdonalds or shell. none of these actors are as well-known for violence as al queda, but all have been accused of some form of violence that was once solely perpetuated by countries. and more troubling, all of these actors seem to have more propensity toward violence than modern states. with by far the largest military in the world, america could easily be considered a model of state-sponsored war, and america\'s wars are increasingly farther apart with fewer casualties. meanwhile these non-state actors seem to be increasingly violent as they are increasingly powerful.</p>\r\n<p>a large reason for this gradual shift away from war in america is that america is democratic. those citizens who remember and regret vietnam, for example, are unlikely to vote for representatives who seem likely to repeat that kind of war. but if the vast majority of the world\'s citizens oppose the actions of the IMF or al queda - and i would guess that they do - these organizations are not structured in such a way that their actions will reflect changing cultural views toward organized violence.</p>\r\n<p>in \"<a

Now the computation works in the opposite direction Costs clearly exceed benefits.</blockquote>\r\n<p>john keegan is optimistic about the end of warfare, but his vision of this end doesn\'t seem to take into consideration the new non-state war-makers, which are less compelled by what most human beings think of war. i am less optimistic. it seems plausible to me that keegan is making the same mistake in his optimism that he accuses clausewitz (\"war is the continuation of policy by other means\") of making in his own history of war - that of not recognizing that modern actors and tactics of war are not the only possible means of making war. it may be war will not end, but merely shift from an activity of the state to an activity of emerging non-state actors. and if that is that case, the world may be worse as a result.</p>','2004-02-17 05:31:44'),(491,'worse before better','<p>a friend of mine from san francisco sent me an email, stating how proud she is of her city for making a bold stand for equality. today <a href=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net/fires/culture/no_other_word_works_but_great.htm\">burningbird</a> writes:</p>\r\n<blockquote>Watching the story online and on TV about Gavin Newsom\'s <a href=\"http://www.miami.com/mld/miamiherald/news/nation/7963377.htm\">carefully planned</a> act of defiance against the State of California, the  weekend of gay marriages in San Francisco, the ecstatic faces of the people married -- among all the bad news lately, it is a true bright spot. </blockquote>\r\n<p>i\'m reminded of <a href=\"http://www.lyricsxp.com/lyrics/s/san_francisco_scott_mckenzie.html\">scott mckenzie\'s song \"san francisco\"</a>:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>If you\'re goin\' to San Francisco<br/>\r\nBe sure to wear some flowers in your hair<br/> \r\nIf you\'re goin\' to San Francisco<br/>\r\nYou\'re gonna meet some gentle people there</p>\r\n<p>For those who come to San Francisco<br/> \r\nSummertime will be a love-in there<br/>\r\nIn the streets of San Francisco<br/>\r\nGentle people with flowers in their hair<br/> \r\nAll across the nation<br/>\r\nSuch a strange vibration<br/>\r\nPeople in motion<br/>\r\nThere\'s a whole generation<br/> \r\nWith a new explanation<br/>\r\nPeople in motion, people in motion</p>\r\n<p>For those who come to San Francisco<br/> \r\nBe sure to wear some flowers in your hair<br/>\r\nIf you come to San Francisco<br/>\r\nSummertime will be a love-in there</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>right now, it is indeed a love-in there, and that\'s great and all, but i think it\'s important for those of us who support gay rights to recognize that it\'s going to get worse before it gets better. <a href=\"http://www.andrewsullivan.com/index.php?dish_inc=archives/2004_02_15_dish_archive.html#107704177894363024\">andrew sullivan</a>, a gay conservative writer who is in favor of gay marriage, writes:</p>\r\n<blockquote>I\'m sure many of those newly married couples would also gladly go through the arrest procedure.

<a href=\"http://wequitdrinking.typepad.com\">quit</a> but I was after something different: I wanted to drink less and, when I did drink, I wanted it to be from choice rather than habit. <em>For me</em>, quitting would simply mean replacing one type of obsessive-compulsive behavior with another.</blockquote>\r\n<p>i think the same was true for me when i swore off alcohol in the past, but i never realized it until reading this. so i thought i should look at the other popular things i don\'t do, but i don\'t think any of them fall into the same category. i don\'t do any drugs, but i think that\'s based on some pretty objective sources suggesting that drugs would be quite harmful to my health (particularly so because i\'m thin and diabetic -- your mileage may vary). i don\'t eat meat, but i don\'t think i can really be non-obsessive about that. if you don\'t eat meat for a while, your body adjusts to treat meat as an inedible substance. eating meat causes sickness for anyone who has been vegetarian for as long as i have. i\'m sure there are ways of re-introducing meat into my diet that wouldn\'t cause sickness, but i never much liked meat when i did eat it, so i think between that and the sickness factor, i\'m pretty safely outside of obsessive-compulsive behaviour here. i don\'t think i have any other unflexible habits, but i trust my readership will let me know if i\'m mistaken.</p>\r\n<p>on to the next point of comment. this time jonathon quotes  <a href=\"http://allied.blogspot.com/2004_01_11_allied_archive.html#107402068033318754\">jeneane sessum</a> on the growing perception of an elitist culture within weblogging:</p>\r\n<blockquote>Yes, I do think a divide is emerging within a medium that attracted us initially by its flatness?no one really wielding any more power than another except through the quality of their writing and ideas and the strength and power of their individual voice?</blockquote>\r\n<p>i have two comments on this. first, i think this divide has been emerging as long as weblogging has, and what\'s been emerging more recently is recognition of the divide. i\'m reminded of being told once (i don\'t know if this is true, but it makes a good story either way) that the american government has only ever broken monopolies after they\'ve destroyed themselves already. i think we might be recognizing the divide in weblogging after it would be possible to do much about it. i think the all-stars of weblogging have already left the rest of us with no reconciliation in sight. those of us further from these all-stars aren\'t particularly bothered by this, but the claims of impartiality are getting a bit tired.</p>\r\n<p>my second comment is that this is exactly what happens with any group that is critical of another group\'s unfairness but offers no solution to it more substantial than \"put us in charge.\" the communists were critical of capitalist unfairness, only to be unfair themselves as soon as they gained power. the democratic criticisms of bush\'s abuses of power sound an aweful lot like republican criticisms of clinton. and now the webloggers were critical of big media keeping them out only to be

could be twice as good or twice as bad. a good politician would say \"ownership is good for you and bad for me.\" but sadly most american politicians seem to be saying \"ownership is bad for you and good for me.\"</p>\r\n<p>ownership is decision making ability as far as economics are concerned, and how politicians view decision making ability in the economic realm tends to reflect how they view decision making in other realms. bush, for example, seems to support competition, except where his own interests are at stake. then he supports state-sponsored monopolies (like haliburton) that look an aweful lot like how things work under communism. he likewise voiced support for states\' rights to make their own decisions regarding gay marriage, until they started making decisions he didn\'t like. then he supported taking that decision making ability away from them. similarly, he supported the judicial branch\'s right to interpret the constitution when their doing so gave him the presidency. but then they began interpretting it in ways he didn\'t like (gay marriage, affirmative action, etc.). now he calls them \"activist judges\".</p>\r\n<p>the new division in

Plus, it makes me think of George Michael, and I&#8217;m not really a fan.</p>\r\n<p>After that, I didn&#8217;t seriously consider changing my name until I got married. Unfortunately, my wife&#8217;s last name is &#8220;Montgomerie,&#8221; which is not exactly a step up on the ease-of-spelling scale. So I kept my last name, and she kept hers, which leads to the question of what last name we might give to potential children. All I know is, it certainly will not be &#8220;Montgomerie-Reynen.&#8221; I wouldn&#8217;t inflict that kind of pain on my worst enemy, much less a child. So maybe a completely new last name would be good.

For example, when we smile certain neurons are active in our brains, when we see others smile, a different set of neurons are active, and those that are active in both situations are mirror neurons.  These neurons are how we learn, how we relate to others, and largely the foundation of all civilization. So I was watching this with some interest when, towards the end, the topic turned to autism.</p>\r\n<p>For nearly everyone I know, autism is defined as the condition Dustin Hoffman had in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095953/\">Rain Man</a>.  Some theorize that a lack of functional mirror neurons causes autism. The theory is that autistic people don\'t have enough working mirror neurons, so they have trouble picking up subtle social cues. When they see someone make a particular face to express some emotion, they don\'t learn what that face means. And eventually they grow to prefer activities they do understand, such as the Legos an autistic boy plays with in the Nova video I watched. There is a woman in this scene, presumably a scientist of some sort, watching the boy playing with Legos, studying him. When I saw that, I remembered a very similar scene from my own childhood, and suddenly I began wondering if I might be autistic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There was a time during my childhood when a woman would regularly come to my house to watch me play with tinker toys. She would give me a pile of tinker toys, show me a picture of a completed object made of tinker toys, and then I would try to construct the object. The only object I remember was a ferris wheel, probably because it took me a long time to make.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turns out that had nothing to do with autism. I called my mom and asked her about it, and she told me that the woman was doing some sort of study on how different parenting styles affect children. My mom was also rather dismissive of my thoughts that I might be autistic. She suggested I learn more about autism. My mother was a grade school teacher and has had a few autistic students, so I thought if she didn\'t think I might be autistic, it wasn\'t worth further investigation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But then I started writing a new song, and it ended up being about an autistic kid. I started reading more about autism to finish the song. Then I came across a description of \"<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1400032717/\">The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night</a>,\" a book Jessica happened to give me for Christmas because she thought I would enjoy it (I did). It turns out the narrator of the book is autistic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As I read more and more about autism, I increasingly felt like I was reading about myself. Descriptions such as \"prefers to be alone\" and \"little or no eye contact\" (from <a href=\"http://www.autism-society.org/site/PageServer?pagename=autismcharacteristics\">the Autism Society of America</a>) could probably describe any introvert. Many people who know me would say these phrases don\'t describe me. I think that\'s largely because I\'m faking it. Almost all eye contact I make is a conscious effort to act normal. I know normal people make eye contact and I try to do the same. Most people make eye contact without thinking about it, but I generally don\'t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other descriptions of autistic behavior seem more specifically desriptive of me. For example, computer programming is popular among autistics, according to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autism\">the Wikipedia article on autism</a>, and I like to program. I think the \"excessively lines up toys or other objects\" characteristic, also from Wikipedia, is what really convinced me that I was on to something. My co-workers  point out how odd it is that my thumb tacks are sorted by color, and my rubber bands by size and thickness. I don\'t know anyone else who does this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not everything is in its place in my apartment, but everything <em>has</em> a place. I can look at something and know where it should go. And it bothers me when Jessica is staying with me and there is suddenly stuff laying around that I am unable to put in a place, if only conceptually. I previously thought I was just strange in these ways, but now I have a name for this strangeness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Initially, that name was \"maybe autism.\" After too many comparisons to \"Rain Man\" I briefly tried describing what I thought was \"very mild autism,\" but most people imagine autism is an either/or condition, rather than the wide spectrum that it is. It was suggested to me that I might have Asperger\'s syndrome rather than autism, and this is the current name I\'m using. I choose this name not so much because I think it\'s more descriptive - I don\'t even know what the difference is between asperger\'s syndrome and \"mild autism,\" though I gather there is one - but because it reliably avoids comparisons to \"Rain Man.\"</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I haven\'t yet spoken with anyone who seems to know more about this than I do. Nut like any good case of Asperger\'s, I trust the judgement of an automated computer program over a person anyway (just kidding ... sort of). I think I took <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/9.12/aqtest.html\">the Wired AQ test</a> when it first made rounds a few years ago, and I vaguely remember scoring just short of autistic and being surprised by this. I took it again recently and scored solidly autistic this time. I\'m sure the score increase can be attributed to different expectations the two times I took the test, but both times point toward what I now strongly suspect: that I have Asperger\'s syndrome.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what now? I\'ve already found this bit of self-knowledge much more useful than previous bits.

Yours for only 8 dollars!\"</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>I missed those guys. Probably around the same time I was reading a sign near the Libertarian demonstrator table. The sign had a phone number: \"1-800-ELECTUS.\" I commented on how desperate that phone number seemed - no issues at all, just \"elect us.\" Then we crossed the street to get a gander at the counter-demonstrators. When I saw the Libertarian counter-demonstrators, I felt sorry for the Libertarian Party, protesting against itself.</p>\r\n<p>My favorite sign of the day was an outline of America with the words \"Free Speech Zone\" printed over it.

I like the idea of targetted advertising, as it promises to add value to, rather than distract from content. For example, if I\'m reading about a used Honda for sale, I would appreciate some links to companies selling related products, such as the used Honda parts ads I currently see on my <a href=\"http://weblog.randomchaos.com/?date=2004-12-04&amp;title=car+for+sale\">Honda sale post</a> (since sold).

I only wish my ads worked so well. Too many of my posts display ads for weblog tools. The navigational text on every page seems to be overpowering the actual content in Google\'s topic-determination algorhythm. I\'m going to revamp my weblog so that post titles are more prominantly part of the URL, and descriptions are more descriptive. If this doesn\'t make my ads more relevant, I\'ll consider getting rid of them. But I\'m defining relevancy liberally.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I don\'t mind when pro-Bush ads show up in my anti-Bush posts. That\'s related, if ironically so. I have a faith that knowledge is ultimately good. That\'s why I regularly read authors with whom I regularly disagree. If I\'m interested in an issue, I\'m also interested in dissenting opinions on that issue. So this doesn\'t bother me as it apparently does others.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nor do I think the internet is succeptable to the same corruption as the real world, as Jonathon implies when he writes <q>I can hardly bear to watch as the Talleyrands corrupt something that was, for a while, magical.</q> In the real world the corrupt have the power to change the rules for everyone else. Talleyrand, for example, used his power working under Napoleon to kill people. But the internet\'s structure makes analogous activities impossible. Not only could you not possibly kill me via the internet, but you can\'t even make me read something I find uninteresting. Every online transaction requires consent by everyone involved. If I don\'t want you reading my website, I can tell my server to stop responding to requests from you (so long as I can identify you).

The only problem is that those who, like me, find the ads occassionally valuable don\'t currently have the option of adding them where they don\'t exist. So we are losing what to us is useful functionality when these ads are taken away. But I\'m not about to tell, or even ask, website owners to add Google ads just to make me happy. Why would I, when I can do it myself?</p>\r\n<p>I made my first Greasemonkey script, <a href=\"http://www.randomchaos.com/software/firefox/greasemonkey/aga/\">Add Google Ads</a>, which adds Google ads to the top of every page (requires Firefox and Greasemonkey). For the curious, Jonathon\'s anti-Google ad post has Google ads for \"Free Instant Ordination\" and \"Abbott Church Goods,\" while Shelley\'s has ads for \"Directional Drilling\" and \"Rotary Steerable Tools.\" Hmm ... maybe this isn\'t as useful as I had thought it would be.</p>\r\n<p>As they say, it don\'t take <a href=\"http://www.weather.com/\">weather.com</a> to see which way the wind blows.

But it seems to me the vast majority of these arguments focus more on the passions than the issues. So much so that one could easily hear arguments on both sides and conclude that they are talking about two completely different issues.</p>\r\n<p>Consider a liberal understanding of conservative positions: they support life of something as abstract as a clump of stem cells, but betray those values when it comes to actual people accused of a capital crime. Conversely, the conservative understanding of liberal positions: they support the life of a convicted killer, but not that of an innocent baby. I think these are both misrepresenting the opposition. Misrepresentation starts as dishonesty, but in this case it\'s been going on for so long that most people actually believe it. It\'s moved from dishonesty to ignorance. Ignorance won\'t help win an argument, so both sides should have an incentive to better understand the other.</p>\r\n<p>I personally take the liberal position on all of these issues, but I think both sides rest on basic convictions that are reasonable and generally ignored. A basic liberal position might be that anyone with the capicity to make intelligent choices about their own life or death should be free to do so. A basic conservative position might be that anyone with the capicity to make intelligent choices should be held responsible for those choices.</p>\r\n<p>So convicted killers should be held responsible for their choices to murder through the death penalty, or convicted killers should retain the right to choose when they should die, from respective conservative or liberal perspectives. And women with unwanted pregnancies should be held responsible for their choices by being compelled to give birth, or they should be free to choose to terminate their pregnancies (so long as the fetus lacks the capicity for intelligent choice.)</p>\r\n<p>These positions leave plenty of room for argument. There\'s the general argument: which is more important, freedom or responsibility? And specific arguments such as: how do we decide who has the capacity to make intelligent choices? But few are having these arguments. Instead, nearly everyone involved is attributing disagreement to pure malice and talking past each other. I suspect we will all come to regret this.</p>','2005-03-24 19:46:58'),(626,'RSS Filter Gets Positive','<p>In a comment to my post about <a href=\"http://weblog.randomchaos.com/rssfilter/\">the RSS filter</a> I made, <a href=\"http://weblog.randomchaos.com/?date=2004-01-08&amp;title=RSS+filter#comment-1164\">Herr Theoretiker</a> wrote <q>I like this feature; however, would it be possible to create a filter that *includes* certain keywords instead of *excluding* them?

I started with a recipe a coworker gave me for thin mint cookies. I most recently made chocolate-covered strawberries, which are the easiest thing I\'ve made, but the most impressive to others. People at work went on and on saying \"Wow Scott, you made these strawberries?! Great job!\" as if I had actually grown the strawberries.</p>\r\n<p>They liked the thin mints too, but were less enthusiastic, which is ironic since they are more difficult to make. Most of the work is in the dipping, and strawberries are easy because they come with a dipping mechanism (the leaves) attached, so they don\'t need to be completely covered. It isn\'t easy to completely cover something in chocolate while holding it. The trick is to put a bit too much chocolate on. That way when you remove whatever you were holding it with - I\'ve been using a platic fork with the middle two prongs snapped off - the excess chocolate will fill the void it leaves.</p>\r\n<img src=\"http://typewriting.org/image/article/content/melted_chocolate.jpg\" alt=\"melted chocolate\"/>\r\n<p>Another difficulty in making chocolate covered foods is melting the chocolate. If you want to melt chocolate, you should do it in a double-boiler to prevent it from heating too quickly.  If chocolate is too cold, it won\'t run smoothly until it\'s heated, but if it gets too hot, it coagulates and it won\'t run smoothly ever again. I know this because I\'ve done it wrong a few times. Yesterday I was trying to explain something to a friend of mine with whom I often have heated discussions, and it occurred to me that discussions heat like chocolate.

The story was told to promote Eli Lilly\'s position on patents. I\'m not clear on all that was said, but I gather the patent system will soon get worse, not better. The debate was largely over the process by which two companies should dispute a mutually claimed patent. I didn\'t see anyone suggest that there might be situations in which patents should not be held by anyone. I think allowing people to profit from the medical problems of others is something we will some day look back at and wonder how that could have happened.</p>\r\n<p>I have no reason to believe that Eli Lilly is any better or worse than any other pharmaceutical manufacturer. I had a vague sense that pharmaceutical manufacturers are generally bad. Specifically, I suspected they often put profit ahead of the public good. It didn\'t take a lot of research to confirm this suspicion. Eli Lilly is a member of the <a href=\"http://www.bio.org/members/biomembers.asp?list=E\">Biotechnology\r\nIndustry Organization</a>, which in 2003 <a href=\"http://www.diabetesselfmanagement.com/article.cfm?sid=2&amp;tid=42&amp;aid=1777&amp;sk=5WZ4\">petitioned the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \"to make approval of generic biologics more difficult.\"</a> To protect profits, Eli Lilly worked to prevent other companies from selling insulin to diabetic patients at lower costs.</p>\r\n<p>When I was low on money a year ago, my health suffered because I couldn\'t afford medical supplies sold by companies like Eli Lilly.

Some of my friends and family think I should consider these offers, but I\'m not. There\'s something wrong with an economy in which it\'s easiest to find new jobs when you least want or need them. I have no idea what that something is. I\'m just saying it\'s odd. <a href=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/05/hire_different.html\">Kathy Sierra</a> may be on to something when she says:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>I would hope that all hiring managers everywhere will read this book and perhaps get a new (counterintuitive) insight into why they might actually get a better result by, um, <i>lowering their standards.</i> Although I don\'t think of it as <i>lowering</i>, since candidate A who has this different perspective but isn\'t, say, as young, high-IQ, or classically-trained as candidate B, might bring something even more valuable. In other words, what you lose in IQ points might be more than made up for by other things...</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>There seems to be a lot of group-think in hiring practices, probably because it\'s easier. Rather than actually research so many job candidates specifically, it\'s much simpler to just filter out a large chunk by assuming there\'s a good reason inexperienced or unemployed people are so. To see this in action, currently <a href=\"http://disemployed.com/search/0000000416_/\">one out of every six job ads on disemployed contains the word \"experience.\"</a> Unfortunately, the end result of that practice is homogeneity, not only internally in a given company, but across the whole economy with each company doing the same thing.</p>\r\n<p>Speaking of everyone at work being the same, today I discovered the blogs of my two new primary coworkers, <a href=\"http://ianleckie.com/blog/\">Ian Leckie</a> and <a href=\"http://www.colley.ws/\">Ryan Colley</a>, both of whom have interests very similar to my own.

What I\'m getting at is that everyone out there with jobs openings should stop offering so many to people like me who neither need nor want them, and start actively seeking candidates who are unemployed.

It\'s been a while since I\'ve encountered a formal meme. My original weblog over on blogspot was called <a href=\"http://meme3.blogspot.com/\">MEME3</a>, and to my surprise it\'s still there after years of neglect. I liked how the letters and numbers of \"MEME3\" were all pretty much the same shape turned, and at the time I thought ultimate truth or something would be found in breaking down false dichotomies. That was back in the days when I often read <a href=\"http://memepool.com/\">memepool</a>, which is surprisingly still alive and kicking. So I have a special place in my heart for memes.</p>\r\n<p>But this kind of thing has a bit of the feel of those \"pass this around or you\'ll get cancer\" type of chain emails, which I loathe. <a href=\"http://jessicamontgomerie.blogspot.com/\">Jessica</a> sent me one of those with a \"person least likely to return this\" question, for which she had thoughtly chosen me as the answer. Sure enough, I didn\'t fill it out. The questions this morning are interesting enough, and I\'ve already read them enough to know my own answers. But let\'s not all make a habbit of throwing memes at Scott, okay?</p>\r\n<p>Now, first question: <em>Total volume of music files on my computer:</em> This is a tough one.  I have music scattered about three different computers right now. Some of it is my own recordings, which are of better quality, and so take up more space than a standard MP3. One computer has a <a href=\"http://www.griffintechnology.com/products/radioshark/\">radioSHARK</a> connected, so that\'s full of NPR shows from the past few months. Another has a copy of NetNewWire running filled with only podcasting subscriptions. And my final machine has <a href=\"http://indy.tv/\">Indy</a> running, which saves local copies of songs even if I only listen to five seconds. So I\'m not sure what all I should be counting here. I\'ll just count it all now that I\'ve made all those qualifications. I have, on those three machines respectively, 885MB, 6.97GB, and 3.25GB in my \"Music\" folders. By my math, that\'s over 11GB of audio. But I would guess only about 6 or 7GB of that is actually music.</p>\r\n<p><em>The last CD I bought:</em> I try not to buy CDs because I hate to indirectly fund lawsuits against music fans. I think the last CD I \"bought\" was actually an anti-Bush compilation from <a href=\"http://www.moveon.org/\">MoveOn.org</a>. I think it was called \"Rock Against Bush\" or maybe that was a different anti-Bush compilation CD. I haven\'t listened to it much, but it was for a good cause (or against a bad cause), and it included a then-unreleased song by Elliott Smith, who I like a lot, though as I recall, the song wasn\'t that great.</p>\r\n<p><em>Song playing right now:</em> No audio is playing right now (Jessica is sleeping), but the last thing I listed to was \"Between the Bars,\" by Madeleine Peyroux. It\'s a jazz cover of an Elliott Smith song, and <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/johnnyconspirator3\">JJ</a> played it for me yesterday. I still have it in my head.</p>\r\n<p><em>Five songs I listen to a lot, or that mean a lot to me:</em> I was going to defer to iTunes here, but it turns out my most played songs are those I\'ve listened to repeatedly while learning them for <a href=\"http://losvivos.com/\">Los Vivos</a>. I\'m not sure those should count, but I\'m also not sure how else to answer this. I\'ll just list five songs listen to a lot: XO by Elliott Smith, You Stay Here by Willy Porter, Cold Water by Damien Rice, <a href=\"http://music.randomchaos.com/mp3s/jj_hamon/song_for_a_girl_i_don\'t_know.mp3\">Song for a Girl I Don\'t Know by JJ Hamon</a>, and For Liberty by me, which I just now realize is not on my website for some reason.</p>\r\n<p>Now, meme #2, books: <em>You&#8217;re stuck inside Fahrenheit 451, which book do you want to be?</em> The first few times I read this, I thought it meant \"as which book do you want to be burnt?\" and thought \"what difference does it make?\" It\'s been a while since I\'ve read Fahrenheit 451. But I now realize that this is referencing the books that characters memorized so as not to lose the contents. Shelley said \"when faced with a society that could condone the burning of books, truth has to matter more than beauty,\" and then went on to not really answer this one. But I think the book I\'ve found most valuable in my life would be particularly appropriate for a world in which book burning was common practice: <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0195632087/\">The Essential Writings of Mahatma Ghandi</a>. That may not be the \"ultimate book on truth\" Shelley talks about, but there will be other people memorizing books, so I think this one is good enough to be worthwhile.</p>\r\n<p><em>Have you ever had a crush on a fictional character?</em> I guess. No one in particular, but I think I would be interested in the main characters in many stories.</p>\r\n<p><em>What are you currently reading?</em> In an attempt to understand the big deal about Hunter S. Thompson, I recently \"borrowed\" <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0679785892/\">Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</a> from someone at my old job who I will likely never see again, but I haven\'t started reading it yet. I recently listened to the audio book of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/044022165X/\">John Grisham\'s The Rainmaker</a>. Does that count? I think my last treeware book was <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1400032717/\">The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night Time by Mark Haddon</a>, but that was months ago.</p>\r\n<p><em>Five books you would take to a deserted island?</em> I would certainly not take any pleasure reading to a deserted island. I would probably start with the thickest botany book I could find, so that I could learn about the local vegetation and also have fire kindling if it came to that. Then maybe a boat-building book, a world atlas, a medical book, and a general survival guide. I wouldn\'t last a week on a deserted island, so my main focus would be to get back to civilization as soon as possible.</p>\r\n<p>Now it\'s the fun part where I get to inflict memes upon an unsuspecting population. Bwahahaha... I\'ll pass to the two people I referenced here, who both conveniently have blogs: <a href=\"http://jessicamontgomerie.blogspot.com/\">Jessica</a> and <a href=\"http://www.myspace.com/johnnyconspirator3\">JJ</a>.</p>','2005-05-22 10:31:46'),(645,'How to Pronounce GIF and SQL on a Mac','<p>With all the new features in OSX 10.4 Tiger, and now the controversy over <a href=\"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/06/07/AR2005060700367.html\">Apple\'s move to Intel chips</a>, few have noticed that Apple has quietly taken sides in some old technology debates: how to pronounce GIF and SQL. In brief, the debates are whether one should say \"jif\" (the peanut butter of choosy moms) or \"gif\" (like gift without the \"t\"), and \"sequel\" (like the second version of a movie) or \"es cue el.\"  The latter debate is a little more important (or a little less ridiculous) as it affects not only how you pronounce the acronym, but which article (\"a\" or \"an\") you use before, so it comes into play even if you never say \"SQL\" aloud.  Out on the battlefield, <a href=\"http://www.olsenhome.com/gif/\">Steve Olsen has obviously spent a lot of time expounding the virtues of \"jif\" pronunciation</a>, while the SQL debate is largely muted by <a href=\"http://dev.mysql.com/doc/mysql/en/what-is.html\">MySQL\'s declaration</a>:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>The official way to pronounce \"MySQL\'\' is \"My Ess Que Ell\'\' (not \"my sequel\'\'), but we don\'t mind if you pronounce it as \"my sequel\'\' or in some other localized way.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>During my interview for my new job, I became conscious of my own internal pronunciation when I referred to \"my sequel\" and everyone else had been talking about \"my es cue el.\"  But I managed to get the job anyway. And with the release of Tiger, Apple confirms that I was right. In the new VoiceOver screen reading utility\'s \"Pronunciation\" section, Apple has added pronunciations for \"GIF\" (\"jiff\") and \"SQL\" (\"sequel\") as well as \"GUI\" (\"G U I\" - not \"gooey\") and a bunch more. You can change these pronunciations, but you can no longer run \"an es cue el server\" or create \"jiffs\" on a factory Mac.</p>','2005-06-07 12:13:00'),(646,'The New Job, City, and Life','<p>I\'ve been living in Des Moines and working at Integer for a few weeks now.

I did write my previous post at work, as I came across the information while looking for OSX screen readers to test accessibility for websites.</p>\r\n<p>That\'s a pretty good summary of the job so far: I get to make websites, worry about things like accessibility, and feel free to wander off now and then on  tangents like the proper pronunciation of SQL and GIF.

I\'ve come up against a few snags that could have been solved more quickly by better documentation, so I want to document those issues here both to publicly complain about them, and in hopes that doing so will hasten the release of some wonderful Dashboard widget.</p>\r\n<p>Lesson one: Widget JavaScript alert statements go to the console. I didn\'t discover this in <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2139.html\">Technical Note TN2139 on Apple\'s website</a>until after I had already built an overly complex system to display feedback for debugging purposes. I assumed if such a useful development tool existed, it would be found in <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/macosx/dashboard.html\">Apple\'s Guide to Developing Dashboard Widgets</a>, which contains a code sample with an alert statement, but no mention of where that alert is going. This could be improved by Apple.</p>\r\n<p>Lesson two: There is a developer mode for Dashboard.  This is also mentioned in <a href=\"http://developer.apple.com/technotes/tn2005/tn2139.html\">TN2139</a>, a handy document that is <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=link%3Adeveloper.apple.com%2Ftechnotes%2Ftn2005%2Ftn2139.html\">currently (according to Google) mentioned on twelve different sites, none of them Apple</a>. But I already complained about Apple not referencing their own documentation in Lesson One. What I want to complain about in Lesson Two is that within that documentation, there are instructions for how to pull a widget off of the Dashboard in developer mode, but no mention of how to return the widget to the Dashboard.</p>\r\n<p>I suspect this was assumed to be obvious, that Apple didn\'t anticipate someone as foolish as me would kill the entire Dashboard process, and then restart my computer, only to discover the Widget still floating over everything else on my screen. If anyone else missed the obvious, the process of getting widgets back into the Dashboard is roughly the opposite of the process for taking them out: click and hold the widget, turn the Dashboard on, and let the widget drop back into the Dashboard. A simple mention of this on any of Apple\'s Dashboard development pages would have saved me a lot of time.</p>\r\n<p>Lesson Three: JavaScript\'s parseInt function parses any string with leading zeros as zero.  So, for example, when I was parsing the string \"08\" and expecting it to parse to an integer value of eight, it was actually parsing to an integer value of zero.  This seems less than ideal to me (I prefer how <a href=\"http://www.php.net/intval\">PHP\'s intval</a> function works), but no doubt it\'s too late to change it now, as JavaScript applications have likely been built around this odd behavior. So just beware.</p>\r\n<p>Other than these minor complaints, my widget is coming along nicely, and it\'s fun to develop a pseudo-desktop application using web technologies. It\'s less complicated than standard desktop development for the same reasons web applications are easier to develop. But it\'s also simpler than standard web development, as there is really only one platform to consider.</p>','2005-07-17 22:38:41'),(654,'Location Tagging','<p>Way back before <a href=\"http://maps.google.com/\">Google maps</a> existed, I had this plan to mix tags, a la <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/\">del.icio.us</a>, with a map of a city. When .info domain names were being given away for free, I registered bloomington-normal.info with the intent of some day creating a site where users could create maps socially. I thought it would be neat to be able to pull up a map of all the poorly designed intersections, or all the bomb shelters in Bloomington-Normal.  I also thought such a site could be used by door-to-door canvassing groups to mark houses as visited or unvisited. And more.</p>\r\n<p>Then Google maps came along, and people immediately started playing with ways to interact with the maps. I figured it was only a matter of time before someone created something similar to my vague idea, only on a national or global scale. So I waited. But to my surprise, nothing came. Until now.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.tagzania.com/\">Tagzania</a> is pretty much what I had in mind - del.icio.us meets Google maps. But I think there are a few things still missing. First, locations often have associated websites, and users should be able to pull these websites from Google, or (better yet) add these websites themselves. Second, photos of locations would be incredibly useful. Third, there should be some mechanism for aggregating a group of locations under a single name (e.g. by country, state, city, park, etc. Users are already trying to get this functionality with tags, e.g. <a href=\"http://www.tagzania.com/tag/spain\">spain</a>, <a href=\"http://www.tagzania.com/tag/berlin\">berlin</a>, etc. But this is location data that rightly belongs on the map, not in the tags.</p>\r\n<p>Ideally, I\'d like to be able to draw a box around my house and name that box with my address. Then I\'d like to place a pin at the front of my house, give that pin tags like \"porch music,\" and assign a picture of myself playing music on my porch. Then I\'d add a pin to the back of my house with tags \"dog\" and a picture of my neighbor\'s dog. Then maybe I\'d tag the building as a whole with \"rent.\"</p>\r\n<p>This would allow people to find places where people play music on their porch (which I don\'t do, but might if I thought random people might come by looking for it.) It would allow people to find places to rent, check if they have dogs nearby, and if so, look at the dogs to see if they look friendly enough to consider renting. And these are just the possibilities with my house. A location where things are actually happening has much more potential. Throw in a standardized system for adding dates to locations, and a tagged event map is possible.</p>\r\n<p>For yet another example, <a href=\"http://ianleckie.com/blog/\">Ian</a> is today participating in part of RAGBRAI, an annual bike ride across the state of Iowa, and he\'s posting <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/ianleckie/tags/ragbrai/\">photos</a> to his Flickr account with the tag \"ragbrai\", which makes these photos join <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/ragbrai/\">a group of ragbrai-tagged photos</a>.

There are, as Sam no doubt knows, &lt;em&gt; tags for that specific purpose. But the meaning is clearly not lost without those tags. And this is a good illustration of what I think follows from Sam\'s theory.</p>\r\n<p>There is no firm difference between metadata and content. Both are meaningless, and are only given meaning by the reader. We tend to give more specific meaning to metadata, because metadata tends to be read mostly by computers, and computers are intolerant of ambiguity. But as we use metadata more and more, we increasingly have multiple computers reading the same metadata and deriving different meaning from it. For example, see how <a href=\"http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2005/07/25/understanding_true_decentralisation_the_microformat_model.php\">Kevin Marks</a> and <a href=\"http://www.corante.com/getreal/archives/2005/07/26/kevin_marks_on_tag_decentralization.php\">Stowe Boyd</a> interpret the meaning of  rel=\"tag\" metadata. They aren\'t discussing differences in how humans should and do read these tags; they\'re discussing ambiguity in how <em>computers</em> read metadata. With such ambiguity, suddenly metadata doesn\'t look so different from what we generally consider content.</p>\r\n<p>I think this phenomenon extends beyond markup language to natural language. <a href=\"http://jessicamontgomerie.blogspot.com/\">Jessica</a> is studying high vs. low context communication, which I had previously studied when I was learning Japanese. She asked me if Japanese is high or low context. There was a time when I knew the answer immediately. Japanese is generally considered a high-context culture. But it\'s been so long since I had learned this that I found I had to think about it, probably for the first time. And I found I wasn\'t at all sure about the answer.</p>\r\n<p>There is certainly a lot of communication in Japan that foreigners would not catch from words alone, but how much of this is due to the fact that there is more meaning in words than most foreigners realize? <a href=\"http://www.marin.cc.ca.us/buscom/index_page0009.htm\">A Marin College business communication web page on the subject</a> includes a quote from \"a Japanese manager\": <q>We are a homogeneous people and don\'t have to speak as much as you do here.  When we say one word, we understand ten, but here you have to say ten to understand one.</q> This would seem to indicate that Japanese text holds more meaning than English text. If Japanese is both high-context and the text itself means more, is everything much more meaningful in Japan? Perhaps, but it seems to me that \"high-context\" is very relative to what the text itself means.</p>\r\n<p>I haven\'t thought this all through very far yet, but it\'s already clear to me that I need to learn more about out how meaning works. If meaning is anything approaching <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum\">zero-sum</a> economy, then all of this metadata we are adding is taking meaning away from the words. I think there\'s a real risk that while we are making things easier for computers to read, we are in some ways making them more difficult for people to read. At what point do the tags become the content? <a href=\"http://www.thetwowayweb.com/2005/02/22#a272\">Some would say</a> we\'re already past that point (<q>Links are part of language</q>). If so, is this desirable or should we maybe start reconsidering the value of <a href=\"http://microformats.org/\">metadata everywhere</a>?

I\'m playing around with a fixed-width design, which seems to be somewhat standard practice among pretty sites. In doing so, I ran into the problem of the page titles being too long for the width.

It\'s just one step too many for me to actually install, but the description looks like something that might be more widely used if it were a bit more simple. At some point, I expect PiggyBank and other similar tools will be more widely used, and I wonder what will happen to the web then.</p>\r\n<p>Given enough context, it\'s not difficult to force semantics onto any website. And if the context isn\'t provided on the publishing side, there\'s no reason the reader can\'t provide it. I know where the movie titles are on <a href=\"http://imdb.com/title/tt0356721/\">an IMDB page</a>, even though it isn\'t marked &#60;h1 class=\"movie_title\"&#62;A Great Movie&#60;/h1&#62;.  This is a lesson I learned through working on <a href=\"http://disemployed.com/\">disemployed</a>, and I\'m relearning through playing with tools like <a href=\"http://greasemonkey.mozdev.org/\">GreaseMonkey</a>, my <a href=\"http://weblog.randomchaos.com/myspace/\">MySpace RSS feed tool</a>, and the widget I\'m working on (and hope to release within the next week). All of these tools use context to infer meaning from otherwise meaningless markup. There is more and more technology adopting this method, but where is this leading?</p>\r\n<p>Forcing semantics onto a website will only work so long as the website maintains enough predictable structure to know where to put the semantics. When the structure changes, everything breaks. PiggyBank, for example, will require new scrapers nearly every time a target site changes structure. This isn\'t stable. It\'s also not scalable. There are billions of websites, and it\'s just not going to work to write and maintain custom scripts for each one to make it more semantic. At some point website developers will need to start participating in the semantic web for it to work.</p>\r\n<p>But the current trend seems to discourage such participation in two ways. First, tools like PiggyBank and GreaseMonkey, as they become more popular, provide disincentives to change website markup. This is good for the stability issue I mentioned, but it\'s bad for the transition to a more semantic web. Second, as forced semantics tools get better and better at converting non-semantic websites into something semantic, there is little reason for the websites to themselves become more semantic.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe I\'m wrong, and website developers will look at something like PiggyBank, see the benefit of semantics to users, and decide to start using more descriptive XHTML or more RDF. But it seems to me more likely that we\'re headed towards a \"semantic web\" in which the semantics are forced onto websites by browsers and other intermediaries. This isn\'t necessarily a problem, but it isn\'t what most people have in mind when they <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_web\">talk about the semantic web</a>.</p>','2005-08-02 23:46:46'),(659,'Golf Outing','<p>Last month my company had a golf outing.

Since then, cable television has become more and more pervasive, so much so that the broadcast television is <a href=\"http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7593620/\">scheduled to die next year</a>. But I have never paid for cable television. I would have been more likely to pay for cable TV if it was less pervasive, but why pay for it when everyone else I know has it? Not only can I watch it on other people\'s TVs, but I also have a natural filter of all the worthless television, because I never hear about it from other people. No one walks around saying \"Did you see that show last night? It wasn\'t worth watching,\" though plenty of people watch such shows.</p>\r\n<p>I think many in the FCC and the rest of the TV industry are assuming broadcast TV will be replaced, to whatever extent it hasn\'t been already, by cable and satellite TV.

They\'re the addresses for stuff on the web. They commonly start with \"http://\" and beyond that, they range widely in format. Uniform Resource Locators aren\'t very uniform. Part of the lack of uniformity comes from having multiple URLs pointing to the same resource.</p>\r\n<p>To see why this is a problem, you can take a trip to Des Moines and try to find my house on 16th Street. You may end up on 16th Street in West Des Moines, or South East 16th Street in Des Moines, but mine is the one that intersects with Crocker, just off Martin Luther King. Only Crocker is named Cottage Grove where it meets Martin Luther King, which is also named 19th Street or Fleur at various points on the same street.</p>\r\n<p>If you find my street, and then my house, you\'ll still have some trouble, as I live in a duplex, with two entrances in both the front and the back. I could tell you I live on the left side, but that may not be your left when you\'re standing in front of (or behind) the house. This would all be a lot easier if you could just go to http://www.scottshouse.com/. (Actually, you can, if you want to <a href=\"http://www.scottshouse.com/\">order some flowers</a>, but that won\'t help you get here.)</p>\r\n<p>Ideally, every resource on the web would have a single URL. Apple.com is good at working toward this goal. If you go to http://www.apple.com/tiger/ or http://www.apple.com/macos/, you will end up at http://www.apple.com/macosx/. Other sites are not so good at this. An interesting auxiliary benefit of URL-based tagging sites like <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/\">del.icio.us</a> is that we can easily see when a single resource has multiple URLs pointing at it. For example, at this moment, the del.icio.us popular page has <a href=\"http://developers.slashdot.org/developers/05/08/15/0051234.shtml?tid=95&amp;tid=8\">three</a> <a href=\"http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/08/15/0051234&amp;from=rss\">different</a> <a href=\"http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/08/15/0051234&amp;tid=95&amp;tid=8\">URLs</a> listed for the exact same article on slashdot.</p>\r\n<p>This isn\'t a problem if the only site you visit is slashdot, for the same reason I don\'t have trouble finding my house. But if you\'re out wandering the web, and you come across a link to one of these URLs, and you follow it, and a day later you come across a different link to a slightly different URL, you will not have the visual cue most browsers and websites offer to tell you that you\'ve already followed this link and seen this content, so you\'ll click it again and waste precious seconds of your life.</p>\r\n<p>Many web developers may not particularly care about a random user roaming around the internet. But it turns out, as <a href=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/08/12/the-business-of-algorithms/\">Shelley recently pointed out</a>, that Google creates its index of websites by acting as a random user roaming around the internet. When Google happens upon your second or third URL pointing to the same content it starts to think \"hmm...maybe this site is just spamming the search index with the same content over and over again.\" If you have a Google rank as high as slashdot\'s, Google will quickly dismiss this suspicion, but you probably don\'t want Google ever wondering if your site is spamming the search index. Not even (or maybe especially) if you <em>are</em> spamming the search index.</p>\r\n<p>The irony is that smaller sites can least afford Google\'s suspicion or visitor confusion, but smaller sites can also least afford to clean URLs. One of the most useful tools in URL cleaning is <a href=\"http://httpd.apache.org/docs/1.3/mod/mod_rewrite.html\">Apache\'s mod_rewrite</a>, yet few smaller sites have access to mod_rewrite\'s URL cleaning power. For those who do have access to mod_rewrite, along with a healthy (unhealthy?) knowledge of regular expressions, the task of cleaning URLs is relatively quick and easy.</p>\r\n<p>I assume the creators of slashdot have both the access and the know-how to clean their URLs, so they\'re easy targets for finger pointing. However, I also have both the access and the know-how to clean my URLs, and you\'ll notice no shortage of <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=define:+cruft\">cruft</a> around these parts.

Flickr has a nice feature which allows users to assign variable levels of copyright protection on images, from full copyright to various <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/creativecommons/\">Creative Commons licenses</a>. Images with less restrictive licenses show an \"All Sizes\" link which will let visitors download the image in various sizes. Images with full copyright do not show this link.</p>\r\n<p>But the copyrighted images are still freely available for everyone to download. Flickr is relying on obscurity over actual security to prevent downloads of copyrighted images. And it\'s not even very good obscurity at that. To find an image, we need to know which server it is on, the ID of the image, and a \"secret\" key that\'s added to the image address. A quick glance at the source of any Flickr photo page shows that this information is stored in JavaScript variables named \"server,\" \"id,\" and \"secret\" respectively. It would appear that they\'re not even trying to protect these images.</p>\r\n<p>This isn\'t much of a problem as long as only people with enough technical knowledge to look at the source code of a page can find the images, but I suspect there will be a good number of Flickr users who be a bit upset when anyone can download their full-size copyrighted images with a single click. It is with my sympathies for these users that I publish the following <a href=\"http://www.wcc.vccs.edu/services/blackboard/bookmarklets.html\">bookmarklet</a> that you can click when viewing any image page on Flickr to get the original full-size version of that image:</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"javascript: for( i in photo_hash ) { p = photo_hash[i]; } window.location = \'http://photos\' + p.server + \'.flickr.com/\' + p.id + \'_\' + p.secret + \'_o.jpg\';\">Get Flickr Original</a></p>\r\n<p>My goal here isn\'t to facilitate the downloading of images that Flick users don\'t want downloaded, but rather to point out that Flickr has already facilitated such downloading. This is a public service announcement: Flickr has no image security.</p>','2005-08-28 09:43:05'),(678,'Personalized Radio with Pandora','<p><a href=\"http://www.pandora.com/\">Pandora</a> is a neat tool. It creates a personal radio station for you based on the musical style of an artist of your choosing. You can then customize it further with feedback on individual songs it has chosen. I\'d like it to do more to expand my musical interests rather than just continually focusing or shifting them. And I\'d also like to see it incorporate non-label music. But as is, it\'s a great example of where radio is headed.</p>','2005-08-31 08:03:18'),(679,'My New Bike','<p>Last week I bought a <a href=\"http://www.specialized.com/bc/SBCBkModel.jsp?minisite=10080&amp;spid=9354&amp;bikeTab=features\">Specialized Sirrus</a> bike. I\'ve ridden it to work twice this week, and expect it to be my standard transport to work. With gas alone at current prices, I will need to save about 250 gallons before I pay it off savings. My tank holds about 15 gallons, so that makes about 17.5 fill-ups. At my standard of a a fill-up roughly every two weeks, that makes it about year before I\'ll break even. That\'s assuming I ride about 35 weeks a year, but that\'s also assuming gas doesn\'t go up. I expect those two assumptions to prove equally false.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to saving money, I get exercise on my way to work. <a href=\"http://www.sueandpaul.com/gmapPedometer/?centerX=-93.63724708557129&amp;centerY=41.577250669683295&amp;zl=3&amp;fl=m-e-h-0-1&amp;polyline=ctz%7CFzepzPhTbA%3F%7BSbe@sGdH%7CZnSzK%60a@nFz%60ANVsH%60E%3F%7E@%7CE_A%7DEaE%3FWrH%7B%60AOaa@oFoS%7BKeH%7DZce@rG%3FzSiTcA\">Gmaps Pedometer says I ride about five miles a day</a>.

Maybe adding some percussion and a soft accordion in the background. But for now, this is the recording I\'ve done. I\'m going to call this a <a href=\"http://www.free-soft.org/literature/papers/esr/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar-4.html\">release early, release often</a> model for music, and hope that means I\'ll eventually get back to a better version of this and other songs.</p>','2005-09-01 00:08:02'),(681,'Twenty Cents','<p>I just posted another song to the music server, <cite>Twenty Cents</cite> (<a href=\"http://music.randomchaos.com/mp3s/scott_reynen/twenty_cents.mp3\">MP3</a>, <a href=\"http://music.randomchaos.com/lyrics/scott_reynen/twenty_cents\">lyrics</a>). If I\'m not careful, this could become a habit. This is another rough track done in one take. I don\'t think the vocals and guitar balanced quite as well as they did on the last one, and you can hear a police siren in the background on the second verse. But that just gives it an \"authentic\" sound, right? I spent a while trying to make a real scratch track by keeping a consistant tempo with a click track. But then I gave up and just recorded it, which took about half as long as fiddling with the tempo. And it was more fun.

It\'s hard to think about this rationally, though, when overcome by the fear of an impending car accident. Fear is a useful motivator in emergency situations, but the rest of the time it tends to cause problems. We can see recent evidence of this in <a href=\"http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/TPStory/LAC/20050901/IRAQ01/TPInternational/TopStories\">Iraq</a> and <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/usa/story/0,12271,1560351,00.html\">America</a>.

Everyone knew who the Republican candidate was to be, and few cared about the other candidates, so all the action was in the Democratic primary, and the starting gate was Iowa. As Des Moines is the center of Iowa politics, I expected to see some serious political action when I moved here. But early signs are not looking good. Seems there is a lack of candidates for the Des Moines City Council. This is standard for cities across the country, but what surprised me is that <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20050902/NEWS05/509020371/1001/RSS01\">the local daily paper sees the lack of candidates as a <em>good</em> thing</a> because it <q>will save Des Moines taxpayers $80,000.</q></p>\r\n<p>Let\'s ignore for a moment the potential that an unchallenged city council will waste well over $80k with no worries about future elections. Seems to me $80k is a very small price to pay for a healthy democracy. Have we all just given up on this whole democracy thing with its inconveniently expensive and time-consuming elections and all those competing ideas that require citizens to think?</p>\r\n<p>Thankfully not everyone has. Jon Gaskell wrote an article for the local weekly newspaper, the <a href=\"http://dmcityview.com/\">City View</a>. I\'d link to the article, but it will be moved next week. So instead I\'ll just quote so much of it that you have little reason to visit the City View website. (See how unstable URLs are bad business?) Jon writes:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Nevermind that approximately 65 percent of your property taxes go toward your local schools, the school board is inept, officials lied about how much would be raised by a local-option sales tax (and have the gumption to want to extend it after it failed to rebuild all of our schools as promised), our kids are fat and stupid, our teachers make no money and schools are closing right and left. The only way to ensure that people start giving a damn about who\'s running the Des Moines Public School System is to make sure someone on the ballot is gay.</p>\r\n<p>But 10 years ago, when Jonathan Wilson put his name on the ballot as an incumbent for Des Moines School Board, you couldn\'t keep the people away, as nearly 30,000 voters showed up at the polls. Were the schools in trouble? Was the system corrupt? Were our kids\' test scores dropping to record lows? Were property taxes going through the roof and beyond? Who cares? Wilson was one of those scary homosexual types, and high taxes and dumb kids or not, we needed to make sure a monster like that wasn\'t going to hold sway over our solid educational system. Disregard that Wilson\'s lifestyle had absolutely nothing to do with him being the last board member to actually have a grasp on how to run our school system, the haters wanted to make sure some fag wasn\'t chiming in. So they turned out the vote like only the haters can. And they haven\'t been back since.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Sigh. It\'s popular to blame politicians for our country\'s problems, and they certainly deserve much of the blame. But the voters have earned a fair share of the blame as well. Citizenship comes with responsibilities as well as rights. When we ignore the former, we lose the latter.</p>','2005-09-02 20:18:31'),(684,'Melted All Away','<p>Last night I learned how to play <cite><a href=\"http://chordie.com/chord.pere/www.guitartabs.cc/fetchfile.php?fileid=7185258\">Say Hello, Wave Goodbye</a></cite>, a song I\'ve only heard by David Gray, but which was apparently written by Marc Almond of Soft Cell.

So I played along with the chords doing my best Dylan imitation. Then I started writing a new song. Last night it seemed very Dylan-esque, and I was quite pleased with myself. I seem to have lost a bit of the Dylan this morning, but I think it\'s still a pretty good song.</p>\r\n<p>This time I managed to play along at a steady tempo for a scratch track, so I recorded it in three separate tracks. I think the timing of the three may be slightly off due to a software buffer in my recording setup, and I think there are a few hiccups as I had other software running at the same time. But I think it\'s pretty good nonetheless. I even figured out how to make my guitar sound like both a banjo and a bass, so I can now imitate a three piece bluegrass band.</p>\r\n<p>I\'m sure I could spend all day improving it, but I say it\'s good enough for now.

I\'m skeptically optimistic about the changing marketplace of ideas. I think Kathy does a fine job of articulating my optimism, so I want to focus on my skepticism here.</p>\r\n<p>The title is a good place to start. Kathy explains the virtues of teaching over spending, but I think anyone who has spent a day in a classroom will tell you that if it were possible to buy learning, they would. <strong>Teaching is hard. Spending is easy.</strong></p>\r\n<p>And selling is also easier than learning. Kathy likes to talk about <q>helping your users kick ass</q>, but most users don\'t want to kick ass. Most people, most of the time, want to know what they\'re doing &#8212; not learn how to do something new. That\'s why we spend so much time watching TV rather than reading books. We want something easy. <q>Buy this pill and everything will be okay.</q> If I believed it, I\'d buy the pill.

It\'s easy to blame the Walmarts for stocking crap. It\'s easy to blame the ACMEs for manufacturing crap. But what about the customers? <strong>We buy the crap.</strong> We know it\'s crap, but we buy it anyway because crap is cheap. How do you teach someone who doesn\'t want to learn?</p>\r\n<p>I hope this is changing. I hope people are gradually taking a more active role in their own lives, and shifting towards decisions and products that help them kick ass.

The issue isn\'t depending on a third party site for data. The problem is depending on screen scraping their HTML webpage. An API is a service contract which is unlikely to be broken without warning. A web page can change depending on the whims of the web master or graphic designer behind the site.</q></p>\r\n<p>I completely agree that screen scraping is an undesirable practice, but I think it\'s actually Dare who is missing the point. No one scrapes a site with an API, so comparing the two doesn\'t make much sense. Of course the API is better, but what good does that do us when we want data in a certain format and <em>there is no API</em>? Answer: no good at all. Not only does scraping not at all compete with APIs, it actually encourages development of APIs by establishing an existing market for structured data and creating a competitor for customers until the API exists.</p>\r\n<p>Case in point: <a href=\"http://weblog.randomchaos.com/myspace/\">I scrape MySpace and provide RSS feeds</a>. I don\'t even use MySpace myself, but I want to read the weblogs of my friends who do via RSS, so I made this scraper. When I put it online, I discovered there are many other people who want to use MySpace RSS feeds. When these people do <a href=\"http://www.google.com/search?q=myspace+rss\">a Google search for \"myspace rss,\"</a> they currently find a full page of results, begining with my scraper. Myspace.com only shows up on the second page. This is bad business for MySpace. They\'ve lost control of the experience of these potential customers. They need an API.</p>\r\n<p>And <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2005/09/07/MySpace_has_RSS/\">they got one</a>. I don\'t imagine my scraper had much to do with it in this case, but I have scraped smaller sites who didn\'t provide a feed until my scraper was being used by a significant portion of their readers. This puts such sites in a position where they need to provide the structured data their visitors clearly want or lose those visitors.</p>\r\n<p>Screen scraping brings an increased risk of breakage, as I\'ve experienced a few times already with the MySpace scraper. But without an alternative API, the structured data is worth that risk for many people.

I don\'t expect the world can keep up current meat consumption, so I became vegetarian to prepare myself. I think we\'re moving towards an economy of ideas, and away from agriculture, manufacturing, and service. So I\'m a programmer to prepare myself.

I work as a web developer at an advertising agency, so I have a particular interest in how technology changes the advertising game, and until this discussion, I was watching what Hugh McLeod is doing from a distance and finding it interesting. But then he pointed to someone criticizing the whole thing, and the criticisms made some sense.</p>\r\n<p>But I wouldn\'t likely have spent much time thinking about it if Hugh hadn\'t launched into the now clich&#233; diatribe about how large organization X is just attacking the little guy because it knows technology is empowering the little guy and larger organization X is doomed. In this case, large organization X seemed obviously irrelevant to the conversation.</p>\r\n<p>So I pointed this out, as did others, but Hugh didn\'t make any movement away from the ridiculousness, saying <q>I\'m being paid to piss Big Money off.</q> I think this is just a few steps away from saying \"if you don\'t like my business plan, the terrorists have already won.\" It\'s just dragging out a boogeyman to drum up support. So I lost some respect for Hugh there.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.plasticbag.org/archives/2005/09/a_response_to_the_rhetoric_of_weblog_marketing.shtml\">Tom Coates</a> was involved in this conversation too, and writes:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>I\'m totally fed up of people standing up and waving a flag for the death of institutions based on sketchy information and a vague belief in the rightness of their cause - and I\'m also slightly sick of more moderate voices being drowned out under the revolutionary fervour of people fresh with their first wave of excitement about user-generated content on the web.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Me too. But I\'m not sure what to do about it, nor even how to avoid participating in the cycle myself. A few weeks ago I got involved in one of these discussions and found myself on both sides in different contexts. A friend of mine who is not particularly interested in technology started an email discussion about how she doesn\'t think new technology like Tivo is really improving anything. I don\'t use Tivo, but I pointed out how I think Tivo is part of a larger trend of empowering the audience to participate more and passively consume less, which I think leads to more niche marketing.</p>\r\n<p>She was pointing out everything wrong with technology, so I started pointing out everything great about technology. The same day, <a href=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/\">Kathy Sierra wrote a post about how marketing is being improved by technology</a> and I found myself taking the exact opposite position, pointing out that marketing remains a dangerous game even online. So in the same day I took opposing positions on the same issue, neither of which really represented my opinion.</p>\r\n<p>If someone had asked me what I think about technology and marketing, I would have given an answer somewhere in between. I think technology is slightly altering the marketing game in ways which could be exploited to make large positive changes, but like any other tool, the responsibility lies with the users to make something positive happen.</p>\r\n<p>But even something so neutral as this gets read as complete disagreement by both sides. Disagreement pushes opinions away from each other and we end up with extremes.

My theory is that self-improvement practices from distant lands more often than not act as a particularly effective placebo.</p>\r\n<p>I used to be very interested in Buddhism. I got some books on the subject, even took a course in university, and some of it I found useful, but never life-altering. But one after another, I\'ve listened to friends and acquaintances with major personal problems extoll the virtues of this or that Asian self-improvement technique after a week or a month of practice. The thing is, they\'re still just as messed up. They just don\'t realize it anymore because they\'ve convinced themselves that Shiatsu, or transcendental meditation, or whatever has cured what ails them.</p>\r\n<p>So I\'ve developed this theory. Basically, I think some people with big problems start looking for some answer they never thought of before, because nothing they\'ve done previously seems to be working. And they find some teaching from the other side of the world, and it tells them to do everything different, and they do, and their lives seem different. So they go out and tell everyone else about this great new thing.</p>\r\n<p>Which is great, until everyone else realizes that the person hasn\'t changed at all. They\'re just as angry, only now they have mantras to recite about anger. They\'re just as unhealthy, only now they can lecture everyone else about healthy living. Maybe it\'s just me and the people I know, but the net result of all the eastern evangelism I\'ve heard has been to make me want to stay as far away from a Tai Chi class as possible.</p>\r\n<p>When someone starts telling me how great Asian cure-all X is, I have a game I like to play now.

I have a Sprint account, so I called up to get a free discount, nor realizing how much time it would cost me. The actual discount line only took a few minutes, and I thought I was all good. Just before hanging up, the Sprint representative said something about how I would get two bills - one under my old rate, and one with my discount applied.</p>\r\n<p>In retrospect, I should have just said \"no, never mind, I don\'t want the discount\" right then. This was a clear notice that the discount program was new, and the billing system wasn\'t made to handle discounts. I might have guessed that nothing at Sprint was made to handle the discounts, especially given my previous experience trying to get an overcharge refunded by Sprint. But I was young and foolish then.</p>\r\n<p>Several months ago I signed up for online billing through Sprint. I get notified by email whenever I have a new bill, and I go to the website and pay the bill. No need to pay postage or kill trees. So last week I got my email telling me I had a new bill, only when I went to the website, there was no bill. The website informed me that the service was \"temporarily unavailable.\" After a few days of seeing the same \"temporary\" problem, I contacted customer service. I still have (I assume) a good three weeks before my bill is due, but I can already see the late fee I will no doubt receive for not paying the bill Sprint has made it impossible for me to pay.</p>\r\n<p>Customer service responded that I don\'t have online bills because I switched accounts.  They even gave me my old and new account numbers, which were two numbers I had never seen before, always referring to my account by the phone number. I wrote back that I was not informed I would lose online billing when I applied the corporate discount, and if they can\'t bring it back, I\'m canceling my account altogether.</p>\r\n<p>I got this account when Jessica and I both lived in Bloomington, but now I have a local Des Moines phone, so I\'m only holding on to the Sprint account until Jessica moves here in December anyway. I figured Jessica could just get new phone a few months early if Sprint gave me reason to follow through on my threat to cancel service.</p>\r\n<p>It turns out, I was told, I could pay online. A \"specialist\" would be calling me within 24 hours. Apparently the specialist doesn\'t specialize in calling people on time, as that was about 36 hours ago and no one has called me.</p>\r\n<p>So I\'m documenting this here for two reasons. First, so I have a record of what went wrong, as I have a suspicion it will go even more wrong in the future. And second, to warn others about Sprint\'s craptacular service.

I probably spent about 20 minutes extra time adding and testing the microformats, which is relatively little given the enormous time savings for the first person who wants to import all ninety-some IMVB members into her address book.</p>\r\n<p>And this is only what can be done with microformats today. I imagine a future in which X2V is unnecessary because microformat readers are built into browsers. Where Safari and Firefox today recognize syndication feeds and allow users to import that information into a suitable application with a single click, future browsers could do the same with various microformats.</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, this future will likely be slow coming, as microformats suffer from the same chicken-egg problem that made syndication adoption so slow: nobody wants a reader application with no content, and nobody cares to produce content with no readers. But because microformats are starting mostly with existing formats like vCard and iCal (and soon <a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/hatom\">Atom</a>), perhaps the future won\'t be so slow to arrive.

Microformats act as the documents, CSS handles the visual style, and JavaScript acts as the applications.

I already do a small amount of this with all my scrapers. On <a href=\"http://disemployed.com/\">Disemployed</a>, I add location and time information to each job posting and publish that information in a regular format (HTML, RSS 1, RSS 2, or Atom). I could admittedly be structuring this information more formally to better encourage reuse, but the data is there, in any case, where it wasn\'t before. But this is relatively simple data to add. I know when I found each job post and where it came from, so my application doesn\'t need to be very smart. What are the limits of a smart application? Could a very crafty application actually make microformats unnecessary?</p>\r\n<p>Let\'s take one microformat, hCard, and see how guessable the microformat metadata would be if it weren\'t there, on a scale of zero to ten:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard-examples#3.1.1_FN_Type_Definition\">fn</a> (full name): this could at best be a guess. A name could feasibly contain pretty much any combination of letters. I\'m sure someone somewhere has named a child \"Asdf Jkl.\" Microformats are the easiest way to identify fn. 0/10.</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard-examples#3.1.2_N_Type_Definition\">n</a> (name): same here. 0/10.</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard-examples#3.1.3_NICKNAME_Type_Definition\">nickname</a>: again, no easy way out. 0/10.</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard-examples#3.1.4_PHOTO_Type_Definition\">photo</a>: here we have a winner, mostly.

Dates follow very standard formats, and we could probably identify dates in a jumble of text with about 95% accuracy. But how do we know if a given date is a birthday? We can assume relatively safely based on proximity to words like \"birthday.\" 9/10.</li>\r\n	<li><a href=\"http://microformats.org/wiki/hcard-examples#3.2.1_ADR_Type_Definition\">adr</a> (address): I would have guessed this would be very hard to identify as a pattern, but <a href=\"http://blog.outer-court.com/archive/2005-02-16-n59.html\">Google is already doing this</a>.

In general there are some areas in which microformats are entirely unneccesary, some in which they are entirely necessary, and some in between. Of course, these are mostly rough estimates on the potential accuracy of intelligent scraping. The actual accuracy would need to be determined by writing a scraper and pitting it against some actual data.</p>\r\n<p>In any case, microformats appear well worth the expense to capture that 47% (or however much) of the existing information. Even though email addresses are entirely identifiable without any microformat, as long as we\'re wrapping names in name tags, it makes sense to wrap the email addresses at the same time so a parser doesn\'t need to be any smarter.</p>\r\n<p>While not the absolute simplest method, microformats appear to be the lowest common denominator of structured documents.

Yesterday I was thinking about criticisms I\'ve read of the Red Cross and about how such criticisms might give some cause to not donate blood. Personally, I don\'t donate blood because I was told not to. But I was thinking about people who have no reason not to give other than perceived problems with the Red Cross, and about how such people are very unlikely to give anywhere other than the Red Cross, and about how I make similarly cynical choices of inaction.</p>\r\n<p>As I was thinking about this, I think I came up with a pretty good summary of what I mean when I call myself existentialist: <em>All choices in life should be made between (at least) two courses of action.</em> One should never choose between action and inaction because inaction is just too tempting, and almost always the wrong choice.</p>\r\n<p>There are exceptions, I\'m sure, and some rare people may have enough discipline to consider them. But just like we don\'t offer children the option of cotton candy for dinner, I think we shouldn\'t offer ourselves the option of doing nothing. We exist, so we should do something.</p>\r\n<p> Indeed we can\'t help it, as even doing nothing is an action, and that choice makes up who we are like any other. But now I\'m straying away from my simple summary. What I mean to say is, we are what we do and if we don\'t do anything, we aren\'t. No, that\'s not quite right ... it\'s really hard to talk about existentialism without sounding like <a href=\"http://www.homestarrunner.com/sadjournal/\">Strong Sad</a>.

One of the charities is <a href=\"http://www.gfusa.org/get_involved/\">the Grameen Foundation</a>, a microlending institution. I have a BA in International Studies, and much of what I did to earn that degree was learning about various save-the-world plans and their pros and cons. After four years, I pretty much knew why the world would never be saved, because pretty much every save-the-world plan has some major problems. Except the Grameen Bank.</p>\r\n<p>The Grameen Bank gives small amounts of money to people in developing regions, which they then invest in what they need to sustain themselves, and pay back the money. Just like any loan, not everyone pays back the money, but it\'s not a lot of money, so no big deal. And those who do pay back the money gain both capital and experience helping themselves, which is ultimately much more valuable. It\'s generally an excellent program, and you can contribute to it via the Grameen Foundation.</p>\r\n<p>Today <a href=\"http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/10/opening_the_mic.html\">Seth Godin</a> pointed to <a href=\"http://www.kiva.org/\">Kiva</a>, which does the same kind of micro-lending as the Grameen Bank, only without the bank. Rather than give your money to the Grammen Foundation, you give it directly to the people who need it. I have mixed feelings about this.</p>\r\n<p>At first glance, it appears this direct connection primarily benefits donors, who get to know exactly where the money is going. I also imagine this system requires more overhead than Grameen. But it\'s also more transparent, which is something all non-profits should strive for. And even if it does primarily benefit donors, that should bring in more donors and ultimately benefit recipients. I think I\'ll give Kiva a little more time to establish a history before giving it my coveted banner ad endorsement, but it\'s nice to see new activity in microlending.</p>','2005-10-26 21:18:17'),(735,'The Problem with Giving','<p>In a comment to <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2005/10/26/Microlending/\">my post on microlending</a>, <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2005/10/26/Microlending/#comment-1511\">Jessica asked</a> what I thought about an organization that does what might be called microgiving, giving people animals that grow to be more valuable than they were when given. I\'m all for charity in general, but there are several reasons why this would probably work better if the animals were replaced with loans. Loans are better than giving, despite the cliche about not borrowing and lending.</p>\r\n<p>Local knowledge is better than a plan to save the world. Animals aren\'t the best use of money in all places at all times for all people. The theory behind microlending, largely proven in practice, is that people know what their local community needs, and they just need some capital to provide it. Maybe their local community needs animals. But maybe it doesn\'t. I remember a story - I don\'t know the source or if it\'s true - about a charity that gave cars to poor people, who then sold the cars and bought bus tickets. This ties into the next issue:</p>\r\n<p>Shared responsibility is better than individual responsibility. If I give you a dollar, you are only responsible to yourself in how you spend that dollar. You may want to spend that dollar in the most beneficial way possible, but you may not know what that is, and even if you know, you might not be listening to yourself. You could easily be tempted to spend it on a short-term gain at the expense of a long-term investment. If I loan you a dollar, we have a shared responsibility for how that dollar is spent. We are both responsible to ourselves, but also to each other. Shared responsibility is multiplied, not just added. And when an organization stays around for a while, this responsibility gets multiplied even further over time. Which ties into the next issue:</p>\r\n<p>Individuals are less likely to reinvest than organizations. Reinvestment is good. If I give you money, your wealth has grown. But you won\'t likely give money to someone else. If I loan you money, your wealth grows, and then you give the money back to me, and I can give it to someone else. And over time, I can give money to more and more people. Reinvestment build infrastructure which improves community. And now that I think about it, this is a problem with Kiva, the direct-microlending organization <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2005/10/26/Microlending/\">I wrote about earlier</a>, because the individuals doing lending through Kiva are less likely to loan again than Kiva would be if it were handling the loans.</p>\r\n<p>Another issue is the relationship created by giving vs. lending. We give down, to people who have less than us. We lend   to peers and make them our partners in investment. This is a bit counter-intuitive, but I think it\'s true. Personally, I don\'t like to borrow money from people, but I like even less to take money from people. And then, of course, there\'s the cynical view that <a href=\"http://www.sleepykid.org/log2/blogs/exile.php?p=241&amp;more=1&amp;c=1&amp;tb=1&amp;pb=1\">poor people are just lazy</a>, which microlending preempts and microgiving doesn\'t.</p>\r\n<p>So in general I think microlending is better than microgiving. That said, if you want to donate directly to people, go ahead. It couldn\'t hurt. I think microlending is a smarter way to redistribute wealth. But the world, in my opinion, is not currently lacking in smarts so much as compassion. I should also point out briefly that most of the principles I\'ve described here don\'t hold true on a larger scale. I favor macro-giving over macro-lending, but I\'ll go into that some other time.</p>','2005-10-27 22:10:24'),(736,'RDF my Database','<p>Last night <a href=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net/2005/10/28/the-bottoms-up-rdf-tutorial/\">Shelley Powers published a lengthy RDF tutorial</a>, in which she wrote <q>I&#8217;m focusing on what I call <em>street RDF</em>&#8211;RDF that can be used out of the box to meet a need ...</q> I\'ve read about RDF before, and I read about it again, but the needs RDF meets are still not clear to me.

(<a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0093779/quotes\">I do not think that word means what he thinks it means.</a>)</p>\r\n<p>Apparently other people wrote similar comments, so Cory posted an update:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>30,000 or so people have written in to quibble over whether WiFi stands for wireless fidelity.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>And he went on to post another paragraph about why these people are wrong.

Under her leadership, the studio produced a lot of forgettable shows, but it was also home to the original Star Trek.</p>\r\n<p>I Love Lucy ran 180 episodes. Star Trek spawned 6 different series of 726 episodes, ten movies, books, video games, an entire subculture, and it\'s not over yet. Star Trek has been wildly successful. <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek/temp\">A temporary page on Wikipedia</a>, not yet included into the main article on Star Trek, gives a history of Star Trek in which Lucille Ball was pivotal to the series making it past a pilot:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>NBC rejects the pilot as being too cerebral for 1965 television audiences. However, they like the concept enough to allow Roddenberry to film a second pilot. (This needs to be checked, but I believe \"Inside Star Trek\" indicates that the decision was the result of Lucille Ball playing hardball with the network regarding other Desilu productions and therefore championing Trek.)</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>If this is all true, it\'s especially odd that everyone knows Lucille Ball from I Love Lucy, but hardly anyone knows of her role in the much more successful Star Trek series.</p>','2005-11-06 19:14:42'),(744,'Faces or Questions','<p>I very rarely look at people.

I\'m almost always looking away because I\'m almost always thinking about something. I\'m not saying I look away because I\'m smarter than most people (though I am - and so are you most likely); I just think with more concentration, more constantly than most people (I think).</p>\r\n<p>Sometimes this is a good thing, but it\'s not something I know how to control. I put as much thought into the answer to a rhetorical question as I do into a real problem, not because I don\'t realize it\'s rhetorical, but because I don\'t have an off switch for thinking. Sometimes less thinking would be better.</p>\r\n<p>I think most of my music comes from answers to questions no one asked me. Which is good - I like my music.

I spend all day online, and I don\'t buy a lot, but when I pick up a paper, I look at two sections.</p>\r\n<p>First, I flip to the opinion page because it gives me a quick idea of 1) what issues local people care about, 2) what the mainstream (newspaper) positions are on the issues, and 3) what the alternative (write-in) positions are. This is all helpful for me because I don\'t understand people, but I fake it because people don\'t like people who don\'t understand people.</p>\r\n<p>I suspect this has something to do with a vague suspicion that there isn\'t as much common to humanity as we like to imagine, hence mythology like the Matrix and Battlestar Galactica.</p>\r\n<p>Okay, tangent time. A while back <a href=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net/2005/09/25/toasters/\">Shelley Powers wrote something about Battlestar Galactica</a>, and in the comments I mentioned that I had no idea what was going on, and then <a href=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net/2005/09/25/toasters/#comment20979\">Dave Rogers gave me an excellent summary of the show</a>, and I wrote <q>I&#8217;ve seen the show a few times before, but it never seemed as interesting as this was</q>.</p>\r\n<p>And I really thought Shelley and Dave were just making it sound more interesting than it really was because they were so into it. I\'ve since watched the show from beginning to frustrating to-be-continued, and in the process realized that when Shelley and Dave were writing about Battlestar Galactica, the show I was thinking of was actually Babylon 5.</p>\r\n<p>That\'s a clue to my general ignorance of TV in general, and SciFi specifically. But I really like Battlestar Galactica, and only wish that the plot itself didn\'t seem to preclude a long run.</p>\r\n<p>Now then, back to the newspaper... the second (and generally last) thing I read is the classifieds, because local classifieds are often cheaper than eBay, because either the seller doesn\'t realize the actual market value, or shipping is prohibitively expensive, or they just want to get rid of something quickly and not worry about it.</p>\r\n<p>For all of these reasons, free pianos will always show up in local publications. Because I want a free piano, I will always read the classifieds of the local paper. And because I and people like me are reading them, the classifieds will always be a good place to sell things. And because classifieds bring in revenue on both ends, they will last forever, or at least as long as local newspapers last.</p>\r\n<p>Seth is wrong; classifieds are not next. Maybe TV listings are next. Or are they already gone? Then maybe movie listings. Hard to say, as I don\'t actually look at newspapers much.

I was the first to respond, probably both because I spend all day in front of my computer, and because of my short answer: I don\'t forgive; I forget. I don\'t forgive <em>and</em> forget; I just forget. I have awful long-term memory.</p>\r\n<p>I\'m sure many people have done many mean things to me over my life, but I honestly can\'t think of one right now. I can think of people who I don\'t trust, and I\'m sure there are reasons I don\'t trust those people, but I generally have no idea what the reasons are. So forgiveness is not an issue that really comes up for me.</p>\r\n<p>While I don\'t remember events such as, say, 1990, I gather most people do. And when someone did something hurtful in 1990, that hurt still lingers until it is forgiven. But what does that mean, to forgive?</p>\r\n<p>Dictionary.com <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=forgive\">says</a> to forgive is to <q>excuse for a fault or an offense; pardon.</q> I\'d like to suggest that this isn\'t possible, that we are only fooling ourselves when we claim to excuse someone else\'s offense, that we can\'t help but hold each other accountable for our errors.</p>\r\n<p>In <a href=\"http://weblog.burningbird.net/2005/12/09/she-loves-me-she-loves-not/\">She loves me She loves me not</a>, Shelley wrote of her cat Zo&#235;:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>I woke her up, but she forgave me.</p>\r\n<p>Or did she? Can a cat &#8216;forgive&#8217;? Some people say that animals aren&#8217;t capable of sophisticated emotions, such as love or sorrow or, in this case, forgiveness.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>I thought about this, and I think I am one of those people. And not just cats &#8212; I don\'t believe people are capable of forgiveness either. I believe people can and do love, and feel compassion, even for people who have done them wrong. But I just don\'t think this love can excuse the wrong.</p>\r\n<p>I sometimes imagine life as a pool table. We make choices about our direction and speed. If we\'re smart, we can anticipate the outcome of our decisions. In life, of course, this anticipation is made more difficult because the other balls have minds of their own. But to understand why I doubt forgiveness, I think the metaphor is useful.</p>\r\n<p>The notion of forgiveness here is analogous to a pool ball being struck by another, rolling along, and then suddenly stopping as if it hadn\'t been struck at all. Pool balls just can\'t do that, and I submit that neither can people.</p>\r\n<p>I know the idea that forgiveness does not exist seems pessimistic at first, but it need not be. In place of forgiveness, I offer a substitute: reconciliation. To reconcile, <a href=\"http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=reconcile\">dictionary.com says</a>, is to <q>reestablish a close relationship between, to settle or resolve, to bring (oneself) to accept.</q> The reconciling pool ball says \"okay, you struck me and now I\'m rolling towards the bank, but I\'m going to slow myself down now and stop before I bounce off and hit you.\" This I think people can do.</p>\r\n<p>We can acknowledge the hurtful decisions of the past, and move on from there, but I don\'t think we can in good faith excuse them. Excusing them implies the decisions were not really made, that they weren\'t really choices, that there was some other cause. Forgiveness implies that we can do wrong and not be wrong, but I believe we are what we do. Our decisions form ourselves, even when we\'d prefer they didn\'t.</p>\r\n<p>In the comments to my post on endocrinology, <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2005/11/20/Autism%2C_Synaesthesia%2C_and_Neuroendocrinology/#comment-1611\">Kyle wrote</a>: <q>If you haven\'t seen it already, you may find this story interesting: <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4278538\">Temple Gradin NPR interview</a></q>.</p>\r\n<p>I just listened to it, and it was interesting. Temple is an autistic animal scientist. In the interview, she talks about the similarities she sees between the autistic and the animal mind. Throughout, when she talked about animals, I couldn\'t help but consider how everything she said relates to people as well.</p>\r\n<p>When she talked about how dogs need to know the social hierarchy to get along, for example, I wondered about how the lack of social hierarchy online might be a cause of the superfluousness of flame wars. Perhaps, like the dogs Temple discusses, people online are too often just testing each other until someone comes out on top.</p>\r\n<p>But one part in the interview made me think about forgiveness specifically, and I want to try to transcribe it here, replacing \"horse\" with \"[person]\":</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Let\'s talk about fear memories...Let\'s say a person abused a [person] wearing a black hat, and the [person] was looking right at the black hat. Now the [person] is afraid of black hats...they make an association...</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>She goes on to talk about how she helps the horse get over its fears by introducing them slowly and demonstrating that the associations are wrong. This is not forgiveness. This is reconciliation. And I don\'t see any reason to believe that people are any different in this respect.</p>\r\n<p>Like horses, we get hurt. Like horses, we associate that hurt with something (or more often someone). Like horses, we don\'t recognize when that association is no longer valid. Like horses, we don\'t just drop the association, because we can\'t. Our brains don\'t work like that. Instead, like horses, we form new associations. We reconcile.</p>','2005-12-10 01:23:20'),(757,'Spam is a Social Problem','<p>I just sent the following to an email list that has recently been discussing various anti-spam technologies:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Spam is fundamentally a social problem, not a technological problem.  No amount of clever technology can end spam as long as there are still significant numbers of people out there who indicate through their purchases that they <em>want to receive spam</em>. <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4375601.stm\">The BBC reports</a>: <q>According to a survey conducted by security firm Mirapoint and market research company the Radicati Group, nearly a third of e-mail users have clicked on links in spam messages.</q></p>\r\n<p>Imagine it costs $100 to send a million spam messages (though it doesn\'t cost nearly that much), and each message is selling a product with a $20 markup.  Only six of those million messages need to get through to a willing consumer to keep spam profitable.  And those six people will never be using Bayesian filters or whatever other nifty tools we can come up with, because they don\'t even recognize a problem with spam.  And those six people will also never self-identify, because they are embarrassed about their purchases.</p>\r\n<p>So spammers can only reach them through mass emailing, and the rest of us suffer the consequences.  I don\'t know of any current anti-spam technology that does anything to deal with those six people.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>I\'d like to see more economists and sociologists look at changing the factors that make spam the most desirable way to purchase certain products. Why do people buy propecia via spam rather than at their local pharmacy, and what could be done to change that?

I was at first hesitant to do this, because someone might have a legitimate reason to mention propecia, for example. But then I realized that I don\'t want to hear other people\'s thoughts on propecia even if they aren\'t spam. So you can\'t comment on propecia here, depsite my ability to use the word three times in a single paragraph.</p>\r\n<p>After reading Dave\'s post, I wondered if this technique couldn\'t be expanded to ban commerce from a social space. Here\'s how I would do it if I didn\'t already have far too many projects started:</p>\r\n<p>Run all conversation through a filter.

If any results are found, replace the word with [commercial product], and maybe give each user an anti-karma value like \"pawn of the man\" with a point for each time they use a trademarked word. So because I\'ve used the word propecia five times now, my name would say: Scott Reynen [Pawn of the man level 5] or something like that. And then you could kick me out if my POTM level got too high over a given period of time.</p>\r\n<p>I\'m sure this plan could use improvement, but I think it\'s entire feasible to ban all trademarked terms from a social space, and I think it would be an interesting experiment, if nothing else.</p>','2005-12-12 10:13:37'),(759,'Trademarks','<p>Though <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2005/12/12/A_Method_for_Improving_Social_Hygiene%3F/\">I said I wouldn\'t</a>, I made <a href=\"http://randomchaos.com/language/trademark/\">a simple tool to mark trademarked words on a website</a>, based on querying the USPTO, but it turns out to be not at all a useful measurement of corporate influence on a website for two reasons.

Scrolling is all done, but it turns out that numbers and dates don\'t zoom well together.  To keep the numbers somewhat readable in a small space, e.g. \"90K\" rather than 90,001, I can only zoom numbers by factors of ten. But for dates, the best zoom factor is two, and even that\'s not perfect: 1 month, 2 weeks, 1 week, 3 days, 36 hours, etc.</p>\r\n<p>But last night I realized that rather than changing the values of the end points on the graph, I can just move the them until they match up with a more readable label.

That explanation is awfully convenient as it rests on common prejudices and shifts the blame away from Rome\'s own policies.

And then you\'re not thinking about whatever you were thinking about before the training, back when music was fun.</p>\r\n<p>That\'s my theory anyway: <strong>music training takes the passion out of music</strong>. A friend of mine has his own music training theory, which I suspect is more accurate than mine. He\'s not entirely opposed to training, but he does minimal training. If someone wants to know how to play piano, he tells them to play just the black keys or just the white keys.</p>\r\n<p>By making the instrument simpler, it becomes difficult to create bad music, without really causing the musician to do any thinking that might get in the way of the <em>soul</em> of the music. But I\'m not sure this strategy scales. Eventually we\'ll all get bored with playing only the black keys, and I don\'t know what comes next. At some point, most of us need to start thinking about the music to avoid getting bored. So I fall back on my strategy, which is to avoid training and start thinking about the music less consciously.</p>\r\n<p>I know a lot of guitar chords I couldn\'t name. I learned them by putting my fingers into new shapes and listening to the sounds. When I liked them, I played them again and again until I knew the chords. If I don\'t like them, I never play them again. This is still music education, as I\'m still learning, but it\'s not music training. I have no course to follow, and no next step I feel compelled to do even as it sucks away the fun of music.</p>\r\n<p>So I don\'t like music training, and this is the first thing that came to mind when I read <a href=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/12/the_hires_user_.html\">Kathy Sierra\'s recent post on learning and passion</a>: <q><i>Learning</i> music <i>changes</i> music...The more you help your users learn and improve, the greater the chance that they\'ll become passionate.</q> Note that this is the opposite of the experience I\'ve just described with music.</p>\r\n<p>I was getting ready to leave a comment to that effect when I got to <a href=\"http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/12/the_hires_user_.html#c12443094\">Kathy\'s own comment explaining my position better than I could</a>:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>...for a lot of us, our products aren\'t the ultimate *destination*, but a means to doing something else that we ARE (or can be) passionate about. 37signals creates products that let users spend more time in flow -- using 37signals software to do something ELSE, which could be the thing they ARE passionate about. Some of the products people are most passionate about are simply the tools that enable and then get the hell out of the way so that the REAL thing they\'re passionate about can happen. But through \"misattribution of arousal\" (as the psychologists call it), some of that passion spills onto the product/tool that allowed you to experience that optimal experience or \"flow state\".</p>\r\n<p>I\'m passionate about skiing, not my skis...</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Exactly. By analogy then, I guess I\'m not passionate about music, but something else music allows. What is that something though? I\'m not sure. It\'s some subset of communication that is intentionally ambiguous. It\'s sort of like poetry, I think, where poets choose each word carefully with an eye toward how it will be read. Only music isn\'t as demanding, because the melody can mask the difference between words with <em>flexible</em> meaning and words with <em>no</em> meaning.</p>\r\n<p>So I guess that\'s my second theory of music: <strong>musicians are poets with a crutch</strong>. It\'s a crutch that allows new forms of expression though. I like Nirvana and Radiohead, but their lyrics don\'t often mean anything &#8212; to me anyway, <a href=\"http://www.songmeanings.net/artist.php?aid=34\">your mileage</a> <a href=\"http://www.songmeanings.net/artist.php?aid=200\">may vary</a>. Scratch that &#8212; your mileage <em>will</em> vary. And that variance is what I like. Music, more than poetry I think, <em>creates</em> meaning. Anyone can string together random words, and if they are set to a good melody, people will assume a meaning where none was before.</p>\r\n<p>That assumed, created meaning will be a little different for everyone listening to a song. And different people will talk about their own meanings with each other, and agree on shared meanings. <strong>Good music eventually makes new ideas.</strong> There, that\'s my third theory. So I guess I\'m passionate about new ideas, not music. Good to learn.</p>','2006-01-02 22:48:32'),(769,'Party Voting','<p><a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/dave_rogers/GHD01-06.html#note_2543\">Dave Rogers writes</a>:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>And let\'s return to this romantic notion of \"subverting hierarchy.\" Where did that come from? It sounds like a good thing, right? Being \"subversive\" sounds kind of edgy and cool. The hierarchy is the stale, old \"establishment.\" Hyperlinks \"stick it to the man,\" I guess. Except subverting hierarchy is merely a form of competition, and competition determines its success or failure through measuring changes in rank in a hierarchy. How else can you tell if you\'re being \"subversive\" unless you\'re paying attention to rank? I mean it\'s implicit in the whole idea!</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Good point. This is why I\'m wary of Green Party enthusiasts. It\'s easy for the Green Party to push good ideas from the outside, but I have little faith that they would continue to do so were they to achieve any real control of the government.

Power breeds corruption; Green Party power breeds Green Party corruption.</p>\r\n<p>This mistrust won\'t prevent me from voting Green on occasion. If I  only voted for politicians I trusted, I wouldn\'t vote at all. But don\'t feed me this line about voting <em>only</em> for Green Party candidates because any other vote will be an acceptance of the status quo. The status quo in American politics is blind party allegiance, even when <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whig_Party_%28United_States%29\">the parties change</a>.</p>','2006-01-03 08:59:33'),(770,'iTunes Mini Store','<p>Boing Boing has been going on about iTune\'s new mini store for two days now, and it was <a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/11/itunes_update_spies_.html\">interesting at first</a>, but now <a href=\"http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/11/steve_jobs_apple_dis.html\">it\'s starting to get a little silly</a>.

But I haven\'t seen anyone playing it yet.</p>','2006-01-25 16:42:32'),(777,'Fastr is Better','<p>At one point today there were 250 people playing <a href=\"http://randomchaos.com/games/fastr/\">fastr</a> at the same time. It\'s currently down to about 120. I\'m not sure exactly where the avalanche of traffic began (do that many people really read MeFi projects?), but it definitely picked up the pace significantly when fastr landed on <a href=\"http://del.icio.us/popular/\">del.icio.us/popular</a>, where it currently sits both third and twenty-eigth (twice because I made the mistake <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2005/08/15/Clean_URLs/\">I previously cautioned against</a> by pointing to both randomchaos.com and www.randomchaos.com in different places).</p>\r\n<p>I\'ve had a few notes about bugs, most of which I\'ve managed to fix today. One problem that isn\'t entirely solved yet is that there are few enough tags being used that some people have memorized them and are winning simply because they\'ve been playing the longest. I just started using my new Flickr API key, which allows the game to show a random ten out of a hundred photos instead of the ten out of twenty it was showing before. That will hopefully level the playing field a bit, but I really need to add more tags.</p>\r\n<p>Some people have suggested the tags should be random, but that\'s how it was when I first made the game (when just Jessica and I were playing), and it really didn\'t work. The problem is that people use tags that you could never guess from the pictures, like <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/tags/500v50f/interesting/\">500v50f</a> or <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/tags/interesting/interesting/\">interesting</a> or <a href=\"http://flickr.com/photos/tags/sarah/interesting/\">sarah</a>. So I have to restrict it to certain tags to make it any fun at all. I just need to add more tags to make it more fun.</p>\r\n<p>Other problems: people clearly want to be able to include links with their names, which was possible for most of today, until someone pointed out that it was also possible to insert malicious JavaScript in the name field (by doing so). So now it strips all tags. Eventually I hope to allow only link tags, but I need to remove most attributes (e.g. onload) to filter out problems.</p>\r\n<p>People have been testing the limits of the name field all day, and I need to force the names to be a bit smaller to conserve space, but that\'s not a high priority. I added highlighting for your own name, so that should make it quicker to see where you fall in the list. But the list is too long, and I\'m still not sure what to do about this.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the Google ads are awful. I don\'t want to just remove them because that would drop my pay for this project from the current $0.30 or so per hour to nothing, but Google continues to send various general technology ads rather than game ads. I was hoping maybe other people were seeing better ads until I saw a player named \"spilt testing is obsolete,\" which made me laugh.</p>\r\n<p>Later I saw a player named \"split testing is NOT obsolete.\" I\'ve toyed with the idea of adding chat to the game, but I\'m pretty sure I won\'t, for a variety of reasons. It would be hard to chat and play at the same time. Also, there are enough people already using their player names as flame bait that I don\'t really want to know what chat would look like. And I also kind of like how the limitations of a username forces people to be more creative in expressing themselves.</p>\r\n<p>I expect the numbers will die down eventually, but I hope today\'s surge of traffic will result in a steady stream of users over time.

At first I thought this wouldn\'t work because then you could click on the link and see the tags, and you wouldn\'t have much reason to guess the tag. And it\'s already too easy to cheat. But several people pointed out that it could just add the links after the answer is shown, so this is what the game does now, satisfying both players\' desire to have links and my desire to discourage cheating.</p>\r\n<p>Speaking of cheating, there is now &#8212; I believe &#8212; only one way to cheat. I\'ve fixed every other method known to me. (If you know of another, I\'d like to hear it.) I\'ll go ahead and explain the one remaining in hopes that doing so will make it a less interesting challenge. Basically, the answer is always available in the source of page; it\'s just hidden until you guess it or the time runs out &#8212; then it\'s shown. It\'s pretty trivial to add JavaScript to the page, either through a bookmarklet or a greasemonkey script, which makes the answer visible at all times.</p>\r\n<p>What you get out of this is a perfect score. The other methods of cheating, which I fixed today, would allow more than a perfect score. Because it\'s trivial and you don\'t get much for it, it\'s not interesting, and no one is impressed by those who do it, as they might have been when someone had a million points by another cheat.</p>\r\n<p>But even that was pretty boring, and I never saw anyone cheat for more than one round. Basically someone would spend five minutes figuring out how to cheat, and then get bored and go back to playing the game. Luckily the game is more fun than the cheating, or I would have had more trouble with cheating before fixing it today.</p>\r\n<p>So why am I not fixing the last cheat? Because doing so would slow down the game, and I don\'t think it\'s a worthwhile sacrifice. To make it impossible to cheat, I\'d have to remove the answer from the source of the page. Then when you typed in a guess, it would send the guess back to the server, which would respond saying it was correct or not correct. It\'s that constant querying of the server that would slow everything down, probably enough to cause the server to die (again). So I have no intent to do that.</p>\r\n<p>Now, back to links. There are also links allowed in player names now. This wasn\'t formally requested, but I saw people setting their player names to things like myblog.blogspot.com, so I figured I\'d make their lives easier. This also gave me a new way to do tech support, by putting a link to my AIM address around \"Questions?\" as my player name. I answered three or four questions today, all of which were basically \"how do I play this game?\"</p>\r\n<p>I\'m somewhat afraid this will just devolve into a link farm. There is currently someone named \"cheap domains\" playing fastr. (The domains aren\'t actually cheap &#8212; I checked.) For now, though, low scoring players scroll off the page, so someone has to keep playing to keep their sales link visible. And hopefully while they\'re doing that, they aren\'t sending us all emails advertising their \"cheap\" domains.</p>\r\n<p>If I decide the player names are becoming too full of advertising, I\'ll just remove the links. But I\'ve seen a few people linking to their <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/benseese/\">flickr pages</a> or <a href=\"http://www.electronomo.com/\">personal websites</a>, and it\'s nice to get a better idea of who exactly I am defeating with my superior tag-guessing skills.

In fact, there was no consistent length to a photo set, which meant those who refreshed their browsers more often could get more photo sets, and higher scores.</p>\r\n<p>I\'ve fixed this now, so photo sets are actually 35 seconds, and no matter how often you refresh within that 35 seconds, you\'ll still get the same photo set.

In this post, for example, I could encourage readers to send an email to anonymous.public.ad-hoc.email.groups@wiki4email.com (available) if they\'d like to talk about this idea. If they already had an account under the email address they sent from, they would be automatically added to that group. If not, they\'d get a response with a password they could use to login to a website, where they could type any number of email addresses into a list and subscribe to any group they wanted.</p>\r\n<p>I\'m currently working on dynamic email addresses at work (e.g. department or location-based email groups that auto-update based on our employee database), so that\'s what got me thinking about it.

It\'s such an open-ended platform that it would encourage others to experiment and find innovative new ways to use ad-hoc email groups.</p>\r\n<p>Like any communications system, the big worry would be spam.  But I think a simple registration process and no one really knowing how many people are subscribed nor what the groups even are, would cut that down significantly.

You can open a second window that\'s slightly ahead in time, and see pictures before guessing in your first window. Or you can refresh your browser after you know it and get ten points. Or you can \"give up\" under one name and then submit an answer under a different name. But those are all manual cheats, and I expect you\'d get tired of doing that eventually. What you can\'t do any more (as far as I know, at least) is set up a script to automatically cheat for you.</p>\r\n<p>You also can\'t make long names with no spaces so that they go outside the designated name box. No one asked for that, but it was annoying me, so I fixed it. And the rounds are now six minutes now, which allows for exactly ten sets of photos, plus a ten second break to look at who won. The last set of your first round might get cut off in the middle, but that shouldn\'t happen after it gets synched up at the end of a round.</p>\r\n<p>I also pulled all the text into localization files, which will make it much easier to create versions in new languages.

But the bright side is the constant increased awareness of death. Everyone is going to die at some point, but few of us are actively aware of it. At times I\'ve forgotten, but in general, since I was five years old, I\'ve had an active awareness of death.</p>\r\n<p>Earlier today I decided to take advantage of the nice weather to take my bike down to the gas station on the corner and use the free compressed air to fill up the tires. As soon as I got outside I realized the weather wasn\'t quite as nice as it looked, but by then I\'d already committed to the project, so I foolishly continued. The gas station is about four blocks away, down a hill.</p>\r\n<p>The front tire on my bike was too deflated to ride on, so I walked down the hill. I ran the pump three times as I struggled to position the nozzle in such a way that it would actually pump the air into the tire and marveled at how complicated such a seemingly simple task could be. Then I started to ride back home, at which point I realized my chain and front brakes were both detached. So I fixed those and realized the front tire was still too deflated. So I ran the pump yet again, and then started riding back home.</p>\r\n<p>What I could have reasonably determined was too cold to ride became much too cold with the wind chill as I rode. My breathing became strained as I went back up the hill. After a four block ride, I arrived back home exhausted. I sat down on the couch and rested for a while. I was more tired than I should have been, I figured because I\'ve long been less active than I should have been. I thought I might take a nap, but then I thought I should probably check my blood sugar first.</p>\r\n<p><strong>29</strong></p>\r\n<p>Oops. Jessica\'s at work today, so I could have easily gone to sleep for a nap and never woken up. I don\'t mean to be melodramatic here &#8212; much the opposite. The first time something like that happens, it\'s scary. I\'m sure it still scares people who know me. But after it happens a couple dozen times, you get used to it. Death isn\'t so scary after a while.</p>\r\n<p>You can see this in people who live in areas of poverty and/or war. They see death all the time, and they get used to it. Their friends and family die, and they go on living. For those of us who don\'t see death all the time, this is a familiarity we\'d rather not have. We want to live forever and have everyone we know live forever also.</p>\r\n<p>But it doesn\'t work that way. Reality refuses to cooperate with our illusions. Death happens. We don\'t need to celebrate it, but I think we need to get over it. We need to stop pretending that death is an aberration from the norm and realize that <em>death is the norm</em>. Death is a vital part of life.</p>\r\n<p>Last year <a href=\"http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=152625&amp;cid=12810404\">Steve Jobs gave the commencement speech at Stanford</a>. In his speech, he said:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Remembering that I\'ll be dead soon is the most important thing I\'ve ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life, because almost everything--all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure--these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>That\'s the nice part about being diabetic.

I think life already <em>has</em> meaning &#8212; we just have to <em>recognize</em> it. It\'s like the difference between hearing to a song, and listening to a song. Anyone can hear whether life has a pleasant melody and go humming along to \"You are My Sunshine,\" but you have to listen to catch the meaning. I\'m sure \"we have to listen for the meaning of life\" sounds really trite, but I think that\'s because listening sounds so much easier than it is. I\'d explain how to listen, but I\'m not very good at it myself.</p>\r\n<p>I think listening for meaning is what people are generally doing when they pray or meditate, but I\'m hesitant to suggest anyone do those things. I\'ve had too many people ask me if I pray when it\'s obvious they don\'t. They\'re asking if I sit with my hands folded and recite the same meaningless words they do. In that sense, I quit praying several years ago. And I\'ve had the same experience with meditation. Though it does seem to be more difficult, I\'ve encountered enough meditation evangelists &#8212; certain that if I only go to their meditation class with them, all my problems will be solved &#8212; to believe it\'s possible to meditate without listening.</p>\r\n<p>And then I\'ve met people who neither pray nor meditate, but are clearly practiced in listening for meaning in life. Some find it in music, some in words, some in photos, some in other people, some in themselves. We\'re not at all short on places to find meaning in life. We just need to listen for it.</p>','2006-04-02 13:34:36'),(813,'Daylight Savings','<p><a href=\"http://cdbaby.com/mp3lofi/nakamura-01.m3u\">Happy Daylight Savings!</a> (M3U, <a href=\"http://www.cdbaby.com/cd/nakamura\">via CD Baby</a>) Okay, maybe not <em>happy</em>, but certainly the best Daylight Savings song I\'ve ever heard.</p>','2006-04-02 13:45:14'),(814,'QOTD: Potato Salad','<blockquote><p>Actually, here is the analogy that came to me by way of good old Sesame Street.

I base this suspicion on the clothing I occasionally see hanging among the window blinds. I imagine the clothing is there because the closet is full of dinnerware, which had to be moved so the kitchen cabinets could be used to store hundreds of jars of peanut butter. Everything beyond the blinds is just speculation, but I know that\'s what <em>I</em> would do if <em>I</em> were crazy.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe I shouldn\'t call him \"crazy.\" He seems nice enough. Sometimes when he sees Jessica or I coming in or out, he\'ll interrupt his ongoing conversation with himself to offer some commentary on the state of our neighborhood. \"You go in and out a lot,\" he\'ll call out. I generally just smile and think to myself that he\'s surprisingly perceptive for a man who never wears a shirt. Jessica sometimes engages in idle chit-chat. I think this is probably a mistake on her part, but I don\'t much care for idle chit-chat with <em>sane</em> people.</p>\r\n<p>Today I rode my bike up and down the street several times while twiddling with what I believe is called the \"shifter.\" I\'m not familiar with bicycle terminology, but it\'s the thing that makes the chain move from one gear to another. It wouldn\'t previously move the chain from gear one to gear two, so I\'d have to move it from one to three and then back to two when I reached the top of a hill.</p>\r\n<p>When I bought the bike, they told me I would probably only ever use gear two, but they were <em>wrong</em>. Gear three is for when you\'re going really fast and want to go even faster, which is a situation I never face in my commute to work. Gear one is for when you\'re going really slow, but it\'s still too much work. I use gear one. They probably thought anyone buying a fancy expensive bike would be strong enough to bypass gear one, but they were <em>wrong</em>. I am weak.</p>\r\n<p>My commute to and from work is roughly shaped like a half pipe. I start each trip going down and end it going up. I use gear one as I\'m going up the hill at the end, and then I go to gear three and back to gear two at the top. Then I get off my bike and rest while my laptop starts up, forgetting that I need to twiddle with the shifter so I can avoid the one-three-two transition in the next trip. I remembered today, so I rode up and down my street several times twiddling.</p>\r\n<p>A few of my neighbors were outside and watched me ride past several times. I didn\'t say anything to any of them because I don\'t much care for idle chit-chat. The crazy guy wasn\'t out wandering around in front the yard, so he didn\'t see me.

Previously, fastr only showed photos with certain pre-selected tags. This was a necessary restriction because so many tags are nearly impossible to guess. Using flickr groups makes otherwise difficult tags more guessable by adding some context.</p>\r\n<p>I\'m excited about groups because they make fastr more like what I originally had in mind, more open-ended. Because you can play fastr with <em>any</em> flickr group, there\'s no limit to what kind of game you might play. If you like birds, you can play the <a href=\"http://randomchaos.com/games/fastr/group/birds/\">birds game</a>. If you like cats, you can play the <a href=\"http://randomchaos.com/games/fastr/group/cats/\">cats game</a>. And of course, the reason Phillip was interested in suggesting this, if you like MAKE, you can play the <a href=\"http://randomchaos.com/games/fastr/group/make/\">MAKE game</a>. The possibilities are endless.</p>\r\n<p>In the process of creating the group version of fastr, I completely rewrote the whole thing. Most of the changes are in the background, making it easier for me to make changes in the future. But one major change you can see when playing is that you have to sign in now to play. You don\'t have to register (though you can), but you do have to choose a name first, which is checked for anyone already using it. This prevents name conflict and makes it more difficult to cheat, both of which I think improve the game. I don\'t like that you can\'t jump right in to a game now, but I think it\'s a worthwhile sacrifice.</p>\r\n<p>After working out the new bugs I\'ve introduced (I\'m sure there are many), and upgrading the non-group version, I plan to add chat. I\'ve avoided this previously because I didn\'t want to deal with the problems chat introduces, e.g. mean people. But now I can add chat only for registered users, and if someone causes a problem, I\'ll just delete their registration.</p>\r\n<p>If you play the fastr groups and have any problems, I\'d appreciate a note.

From now on, I\'m releasing later and better.</p>','2006-05-31 23:56:26'),(834,'Companies Can Safely Ignore Me','<p>Yesterday, Technorati released <a href=\"http://kitchen.technorati.com/search/\">Microformats Search</a>. My first thought was something like \"finally...\" It\'s been six months since Google released Google Base. At that time many people were pointing out that submission-based search isn\'t going to work in the long-term because it takes more work than crawl-based search, and all other things being equal, laziness wins. The advantage of Google Base over traditional search was that it used structured data, so the obvious solution was to make the web more structured.</p>\r\n<p>Microformats make the web more structured, so I thought it would be interesting to see how much structured data a big search company like Google could hope to find by crawling instead of asking for submissions. I made <a href=\"http://www.randomchaos.com/microformats/base/\">Microformat Base</a>, and before long, the microformats community, the broader semantic web community, and the entire world were ... completely ignoring it. No one used it. No one talked about it. No one copied the open source.</p>\r\n<p>Well, that\'s not entirely true. A few people on the <a href=\"http://microformats.org/discuss/\">microformats discussion list</a> said some nice things about it. But the conversation there quickly went back to what would later become hAtom. I went on with my life, playing with other technologies in my spare time. I hoped maybe in another year or two, someone with some venture capital would pick up the idea and make the web a more interesting place.</p>\r\n<p>Then yesterday, as I said, Technorati released <a href=\"http://kitchen.technorati.com/search/\">Microformats Search</a>, and I thought \"finally...\" I think I have a pretty good track record for predicting where technologies are headed, and I continue to be annoyed by how long it takes the rest of the world to catch up to my imagined future. I didn\'t expect Technorati to act as quickly as it did, but I made Microformat Base in a day, so it really shouldn\'t have taken them six months.</p>\r\n<p>I was happy Technorati had caught up, but then I started reading what Technorati was writing about it. The first thing I read was <a href=\"http://tantek.com/log/2006/05.html#d31t1802\">on the blog of Tantek &#199;elik</a>. I subscribe to his blog because he talks about interesting technology, and I like to pay attention to where things are heading. Tantek wrote <q>I invite you to come take a look at this first of a kind realtime microformats search engine</q> At that point, I thought \"Hmm...that\'s an odd way of phrasing that. It almost sounds like he has no idea that I ever made Microformat Base...\" Then Tantek <a href=\"http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2006-May/004248.html\">sent an email</a> to the microformats discussion list writing <q>There are some indexers of specific microformats right now (e.g. Reevoo and\r\nKritx both index hReviews), but no general microformats search engine.</q> At that point, I realized that Tantek really did have no idea I had made Microformat Base, which was surprising because I knew he had previously commented on it.</p>\r\n<p>I wrote <a href=\"http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2006-May/004249.html\">a response</a>, saying <q>Hmm... I\'m pretty sure I was indexing contacts, events, and reviews  \r\nseveral months ago...I\'d assume you missed that, except that you <a href=\"http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2005-December/002204.html\">commented on it</a>.</q> And Kevin Marks, who also works at Technorati, responded to that with <q>Great stuff Scott, do you want to get pings relayed?</q> At this point, I was trying to be charitable with my take on what was going on here, but it really looked to me like Technorati was intentionally ignoring what I had done, except where they realized that I could be feeding them data.</p>\r\n<p>So I wrote that in <a href=\"http://microformats.org/discuss/mail/microformats-discuss/2006-June/004252.html\">response</a>:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>What I didn\'t expect was this feeling that microformats are increasingly just another product owned and sold by Technorati.  I\'m disappointed that Technorati has apparently developed selective amnesia here regarding others\' work.  <a href=\"http://technorati.com/weblog/2006/05/108.html\">Tantek says</a> \"Technorati believes in the voice of the individual,\" but here I am, an individual, and everyone from Technorati is pretending like I don\'t exist except where I could contribute more data toward Technorati\'s profit.  I have no doubt that if I had done the same work at a corporation, I wouldn\'t be seeing phrases like \"no general microformats search engine\" and \"first of a kind\" coming out of Technorati.  And I\'m certainly not the only individual who has worked on this.  Dozens of individuals helped lay the groundwork for Technorati\'s newest product, but not a single one is acknowledged in Technorati\'s discussion of the Microformats Search - only corporations.  This will certainly make me think twice before experimenting further with microformats in my free time.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>And I sent it off and thought \"bridges: burninated!\" I\'m not working at one of Technorati\'s partners, so if microformats really are a product Technorati intends to claim or imply ownership of, I have little to lose by criticizing this trend. I was content to do so in the pseudo-privacy of the microformats email list, but then <a href=\"http://tantek.com/log/2006/06.html#d01t1252\">Tantek responded</a> on his public blog.</p>\r\n<p>He wrote a long post, starting with <q>Mea culpa</q>, including my name nine times, linking to me five times, and going on about how great it is that web workers of the world are uniting under the microformats flag of data freedom or something like that. And I guess I\'m happy that Tantek is now reaffirming my romantic notion of what the web could be. The only problem is, I don\'t really believe it any more.</p>\r\n<p>As I pointed out <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/05/31/Release_Later%2C_Release_Better/\">yesterday</a>, a microformat search engine isn\'t the first project I\'ve done a proof-of-concept for that later became a successful part of the web. In fact, nearly everything I\'ve ever done online has followed this pattern, going back ten years to when I edited the raw compiled source of a browser plugin (a simpler task back then) to allow users to add any search engine they wanted to a field in their browser and <a href=\"http://www.macresource.com/mrp/archive/199609.shtml\">released it for free as \"AnySearch Extras\"</a>. It\'s now ten years later, and FireFox is the most popular browser to have this <a href=\"http://mycroft.mozdev.org/deepdocs/deepdocs.html\">same functionality</a> built in. So about 10% of the world has caught up to what I was waiting for ten years ago.</p>\r\n<p>I\'m tired of waiting for the web to pay attention. The web is awful at paying attention. One might think Technorati would be a little better at paying attention than others, given what it does and its ownership of <a href=\"http://tess2.uspto.gov/bin/showfield?f=doc&amp;state=n47tud.8.2\">a trademark on the phrase \"attention index.\"</a> But experience suggests Technorati is just like the rest of the web. Interesting technology doesn\'t get the web\'s attention. Open source and open data don\'t get the web\'s attention. I\'ve been doing both for several years. The web hasn\'t noticed. As Christian Montoya recently <a href=\"http://www.christianmontoya.com/2006/05/15/web-20-i-about-money/\">observed</a>, <em>money</em> is what gets the web\'s attention.</p>\r\n<p>It\'s not just that Tantek originally gave thanks only to corporations with money and ignored all the individuals working on microformats. Tantek\'s a busy guy, so he forgets things. But the <em>whole web</em> today gave notice to Technorati, with money, and ignored an individual who did the same thing, without money. Tantek wrote:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Companies take note - on the internet, there will always be smarter, more clever people building on each other\'s work than your secret internal committees, your architecture councils, your internal discussion forums -- no matter how many supergeniuses you think you may have hired away and locked up with golden shackles in your labs.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>This has long been a popular mythology on the web, but I no longer believe it. I am the prototypical clever person building on others\' work and encouraging others to build on mine. Companies can safely ignore me.</p>','2006-06-02 01:55:01'),(835,'The Dumb Hive Mind','<p><a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/dave_rogers/GHD06-06.html#note_2833\">Dave Rogers points</a> to <a href=\"http://www.edge.org/documents/archive/edge183.html\">Jarod Lanier</a>, who has better ideas than me regarding the tendancy of the web to ignore individuals. He writes:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>The illusion that what we already have is close to good enough, or that it is alive and will fix itself, is the most dangerous illusion of all. By avoiding that nonsense, it ought to be possible to find a humanistic and practical way to maximize value of the collective on the Web without turning ourselves into idiots. The best guiding principle is to always cherish individuals first.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>That&#8217;s exactly the illusion I&#8217;ve been working under on the web for the past decade. I thought if I just threw good ideas into the web long enough, it would improve itself. <a href=\"http://lyricwiki.org/Radiohead:Fake_Plastic_Trees\">It wears me out</a>. \"Always cherish individuals first\" sounds like pretty good advice. I think I haven&#8217;t been doing enough of that because I don&#8217;t trust individuals very much. Individuals can be mean. The collective, at worst, is just careless. And therein lies the appeal of the illusion: it&#8217;s relatively safe.</p>\r\n<p>But I&#8217;ve had enough with the relative safety of the idiot hive mind. It&#8217;s time for me to get back to mess and the riskiness of smart individuals. So &#8230; anyone want to start a website with me? I have a lot of good ideas.</p>','2006-06-03 12:24:46'),(836,'False Identities','<p>If you&#8217;re going to adopt a false identity, I think it should have the same first name as your own. First of all, no one would believe that Scott Johnson is really just Scott Reynen\'s false identity. We expect more of our conspirators. Also, if you should ever happen to get your real and false identities confused, it would be much less noticeable and much easier to explain if your first name was the same. \"What&#8217;s this letter to &#8230; \'Scott\'?\" Why, it\'s just a letter to me. Nothing at all suspicious about that!</p>\r\n<p>I realize this flies in the face of conventional wisdom on false identity name choice. I recently heard someone (I can&#8217;t remember who) say that the only funny line ever on <cite>the Family Guy</cite> was Peter Griffin trying to pretend he was someone else and when someone asked him what his name was, he said \"Pe...ter.......Grif....fin...\" That&#8217;s a terrible false identity, of course, but I&#8217;m suggesting that it&#8217;s only terrible because it isn&#8217;t false. After meeting the falsity requirement of false identities, I think the goal should be to keep it simple, and the best way to keep it simple is to keep the same first name.</p>\r\n<p>The exception to this rule is unusual names like \"Icarus.\" If your real first name is Icarus, your false first name should definitely not be Icarus. This is my advice to people adopting false identities. I wish you best of luck in your life of lies.</p>','2006-06-05 22:55:38'),(837,'Western Iowa Advantage','<p><a href=\"http://www.westerniowaadvantage.com/\">The Western Iowa Advantage website</a> went \"live\" (no longer a placeholder) yesterday.

People like pretty.</p>\r\n<p>But what I find most interesting about the site is something no one else will ever notice: it&#8217;s very semantic. The markup describes the data.

The idea is that there are fishermen who are trying to save fish from drowning, but they&#8217;re always just a little too late, as the fish die shortly after being saved.

I responded thinking I could easily play low key blues piano for three hours some weeknight. I sent some MP3s of me playing guitar, because I don&#8217;t have any of me playing piano. And I was offered a spot on July 7, a Friday night, 9pm-12am.</p>\r\n<p>I accepted the offer, but there are a few problem with it. First, they don&#8217;t have a piano at the Continental Lounge. I don&#8217;t know why they were advertising for pianists when they don&#8217;t have a piano. Did they think someone was going to bring in a piano? I have a keyboard, but it doesn&#8217;t sound enough like a piano that I can comfortably play low-key blues on it. So I think I&#8217;ll play guitar.</p>\r\n<p>But the second problem is that I&#8217;m not sure that I have three hours worth of low-key guitar music. A lot of the songs I know involve yelling. I haven&#8217;t even been to the Continental Lounge before, so I have no idea what the atmosphere is, or if yelling might be inappropriate. The only other solo musician I know, JJ, suggested I play instrumental guitar music, which I&#8217;ll have to do to keep my voice during a three hour run, but I don&#8217;t normally play instrumental guitar music, so we&#8217;ll see how that goes.</p>\r\n<p>The third problem is that it\'s not Monday - Thursday, as the ad said.

I was mostly wrong about people paying attention. Other than people who knew me, only a few were actually listening. After I plugged in my guitar and the mic, I told someone who worked there that I was ready to start and she said &#8220;don&#8217;t you want to do a sound check?&#8221; and I said &#8220;well, I can hear myself play, and it&#8217;s just a guitar&#8221; and she said &#8220;but everyone does a sound check.&#8221; So it was obvious from the get-go that I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing.  I wasn&#8217;t sure what else a sound check would involve, so I just started playing, and it seemed to work out okay.</p>\r\n<p>I didn&#8217;t play exactly what I expected to. Earlier last night I remembered that I had intended to include Norah Jone&#8217;s &#8220;Don&#8217;t Know Why&#8221; in the list, so I sang that instead of Brad Sucks&#8217; &#8220;You&#8217;re not Going Anywhere,&#8221; which stretches my vocal range when sung in two octaves, and is less interesting when sung in just one. Then I noticed I had &#8220;Carry Me Home&#8221; in my first set twice. I probably should have noticed that when practicing, but I blame you, the readers of my weblog, for not noticing that when <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/07/06/July_7_Set_Lists/\">I posted it</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Then at the end of the second set, as I was walking to sit down by Jessica, someone said &#8220;Scott?&#8221; And I said &#8220;yes&#8221; while thinking &#8220;how does this guy know my name?&#8221; Turns out he was a bass player I&#8217;ve been communicating with via email about possibly playing together. He seemed to like what he heard, but I wasn&#8217;t entirely sure what I had just played, so when I went back for the third set, I went straight to the songs that I thought were more representative of the type of music I&#8217;d like to play with a full band.</p>\r\n<p>But then I got all confused about which songs I&#8217;d played and which I hadn&#8217;t. Luckily, I had too many songs in my set list anyway, so it all worked out. I ended on &#8220;With God on Our Side,&#8221; which has a final verse about leaving, so that worked out. I don&#8217;t suppose anyone really had any idea what words I was singing in the final verse (it didn&#8217;t arouse the spontaneous renunciation of war one might hope it would), but it seemed a good way to end the night.</p>\r\n<p>I got paid what I was promised on the spot (which doesn&#8217;t always happen in my previous experience), and they even put out a tip jar for me, which was filled with five or six dollars from people who know me. The manager who paid me, Terra, told me that she liked my songs, but it&#8217;s more &#8220;Tuesday night&#8221; music. Then she said &#8220;we were saying &#8216;someone needs to get that guy a Red Bull&#8217;.&#8221; So I gather it was a bit too slow and depressing, but that&#8217;s sort of what I do, so maybe I just shouldn&#8217;t play on Friday nights.</p>\r\n<p>She said the guy who arranges musicians was out of town for the week, but when he comes back, she&#8217;ll tell him I was good and should go into &#8220;the rotation.&#8221; I&#8217;m not sure how often that would be, but it sounds good. I might get together with the bass player next week and &#8220;see if we mesh,&#8221; as he put it. I&#8217;m not sure how to measure meshiness, but I guess I&#8217;ll find out.</p>\r\n<p>Jessica&#8217;s friend Libby also picked up a business card from the woman who handles musicians at the local farmers&#8217; market every Saturday morning, so I&#8217;m going to look into that. I would have gone this morning, but I&#8217;m surprisingly tired this morning. I guess singing was more work than it seemed at the time. I believe the farmers&#8217; market is all tips, so it would require &#8220;crowd pleasers&#8221; to make any money. I&#8217;ve never been especially interested in pleasing crowds (I prefer to make them cry), but it would be good experience. As I wrote several years ago, and sang last night to the eager applause of an apparently drunk man, <a href=\"http://music.randomchaos.com/lyrics/scott_reynen/stories_and_money\">I heard stories are better than money</a>.</p>','2006-07-08 12:35:17'),(855,'Knowledge and Freedom','<p>Dave Rogers is reading a book called <cite>Heresies Against Progress and Other Illusions</cite> and <a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/dave_rogers/GHD07-06.html#note_2896\">writes </a> <q>The externally directed \"knowing,\" the discovery and gathering of information, while empowering in other ways, does not make us more free. With that I think I agree.</q> I agree, but I think this ignores an important point: knowledge does not <em>make</em> us free, but it <em>enables</em> freedom. Conversely, ignorance constrains us.</p>\r\n<p>The problem is that knowledge has, for many of us, become the end rather than the means. When someone criticizes Wikipedia, too often the response is not an explanation of the benefits Wikipedia brings to real people, but instead a faith-based proposition that Wikipedia is inherently good by virtue of it being a large and growing collection of knowledge.</p>\r\n<p>When knowledge is treated as a self-justifying goal, it can easily take precedence over more important things. When Wikipedia slanders someone, that&#8217;s hurting real people. That&#8217;s a  problem that will only be recognized by those of us who maintain that people are more important than knowledge. Those who worship the all-knowing hive-mind as an eternal source of good are unable to see the problem of people getting hurt.</p>\r\n<p>But I think disregarding the enabling aspect of knowledge is sort of like halting our consumption of water after someone drowns. Water doesn&#8217;t make us healthy, but it&#8217;s awfully hard to be healthy without water. On <a href=\"http://makedatamakesense.com/\">MakeDataMakeSense</a>, I have a little diagram under the logo on every page, which looks like this:</p>\r\n<p>DATA &gt; INFORMATION <span style=\"color: #999;\">&gt; KNOWLEDGE &gt; WISDOM</span></p>\r\n<p>Knowledge and wisdom are greyed out because they&#8217;re outside the scope of the site. I&#8217;d probably go further and say they&#8217;re outside the scope of any programming project, because knowledge and wisdom are best handled by people, not machines. But they&#8217;re still there because they&#8217;re important.</p>\r\n<p>I think \"wisdom\" to me is pretty much the same as Dave&#8217;s \"interior knowledge.\" And I don&#8217;t think that can exist without \"external knowledge.\" I think we get to know ourselves within our context. Some of us understand pain when we hit our finger with a hammer. Some of us understand pain when we lose a loved one. But we need to first understand a hammer, or understand death. No one understands pain without first understanding something else, some external knowledge that could most likely be found on Wikipedia.</p>','2006-07-08 15:23:10'),(856,'QOTD: True Fans','<blockquote><p>I guess I should have felt like a true fan, that my interest in them was &#8220;pure&#8221; and that he and I shared some sort of special musical connection.

I agree with his early sentiments. \"Freedom\" is a complicated concept, and I suspect it\'s not really worth unraveling, so let&#8217;s just work on whatever shared meaning we can squeeze out of that word.</p>\r\n<p>We can know wrong things, and that&#8217;s just as &#8212; if not more &#8212; constraining as not knowing anything. But the only way to find out something we know is wrong is to come to know something right. Learning something wrong is the risk we take when learning. But in my experience, it&#8217;s not a very big risk.</p>\r\n<p>Dave asks \"how much knowledge you want to have before you think you have enough freedom. At what point does the desire for knowledge itself act as constraint?\" I don\'t know what \"enough freedom\" would be in the general sense. I&#8217;ve never met anyone who didn&#8217;t seem to want more freedom.</p>\r\n<p>But in specific contexts, I think \"enough freedom\" is an important question we all need to answer for ourselves. Some people find alcohol consumption increases their overall freedom, so they seek out knowledge to help increase their freedom to consume alcohol. Personally, I find alcohol consumption reduces my overall freedom, so I seek out other knowledge.</p>\r\n<p>I think knowledge &#8212; like everything else, I suppose &#8212; acts as a constraint as soon as it becomes its own end. Let&#8217;s take an analogy: I&#8217;m trapped in a box. I want to get out of the box. You might respond with your transcendal wisdom that \"there is no box,\" but seriously, there is. It&#8217;s made of wood, and I&#8217;m in it and I&#8217;m hungry. Not like \"I could really go for a bowl of ice cream\" hungry, but real \"this hurts\" hungry.</p>\r\n<p>So my first step in getting out of the box (gaining freedom) is to learn about the box. I see that the box is nailed shut. This is useful knowledge. I see that there&#8217;s a crowbar inside the box. Also useful knowledge. I think to myself \"knowledge is so great!\" I look around the box for all the knowledge I can find. I inspect every grain in the wood, every curve in the crow bar, every nail in this box holding me in. I love knowledge! And I starve to death in the box, excited at my newfound knowledge of death.</p>\r\n<p>I think that point where I notice the crowbar and start to value knowledge itself rather than the specific knowledge that enables me to increase  freedom (using the crowbar to open the box) is where knowledge becomes constraining. Dave writes \"Maybe we\'re all about as free as we\'re ever going to be.\" Maybe, but I doubt it, and I hope not. Such a flat world just doesn&#8217;t sound like much fun.</p>','2006-07-10 23:24:01'),(858,'Seriously, There\'s a Box','<p>Dave Rogers <a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/dave_rogers/GHD07-06.html#note_2904\">follows up</a> with, among other words:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>Some people spend much of their lives building and moving into bigger and supposedly better boxes. I like being comfortable. Though I must say, I\'ve learned most of the important things in my life by being very uncomfortable.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>I think there are two types of comfort that have little to do with each other. Those of us who have the choice of whether or not to be comfortable in our current states tend to think of comfort as a choice people make. In an obese nation, for example, we can talk about whether or not we really need to lose or gain weight, or whether we should just learn to accept whatever weight we currently have.</p>\r\n<p>But I think that&#8217;s the exception to common life experience. Most people really don&#8217;t have that choice. They really have a \"box\" constraining them. They either gain weight by finding the \"bigger box,\" or they die. Or maybe the \"box\" is a lack of health care, or a civil war, or maybe they&#8217;re caught up in human trafficking, and it&#8217;s literally a box. There&#8217;s no shortage of real problems people can&#8217;t choose whether or not to face.</p>\r\n<p>In America, and much of the developed world, we have no shortage of imaginary problems we <em>can</em> choose whether or not to face. We can decide when our boat is big enough because we aren&#8217;t drowning. But even for many Americans, that&#8217;s not the case, and it would be insulting to tell someone drowning that they&#8217;re just imagining their problems. I think most constraints on freedom are real and important, and that&#8217;s what I mean when I say \"seriously, there is a box.\"</p>\r\n<p>Probably at some point, there&#8217;s an inverse connection between the imagined constraints and the real ones, when building a large boat requires taking that last scrap of wood from the drowning victims. But I don&#8217;t think this is the norm, and in most cases, the two types of constraints, chosen and forced, have little in common. It seems to me that I&#8217;m focusing on the latter and Dave is focusing on the former and we&#8217;re not so much disagreeing about this being an elephant as we are focusing on different parts of it.</p>','2006-07-11 09:23:05'),(859,'Various Things Everyone Should Have','<p><a href=\"http://www.zenshiatsuchicago.org/people/steve_rogne/\">Steve Rogne</a> is a friend of mine from university days.

I started thinking about how speaking turns are negotiated in teleconferencing. Turn negotiation is increasingly an issue as less and less of our communication happens face-to-face anymore.</p>\r\n<p>Different communications technologies allow for different styles of turn-taking. In iChat, for example, I can see when someone starts to type something, so I&#8217;ll wait for them to finish before going on with the conversation, or I&#8217;ll try to respond to their previous comment before they make another. It can be a little awkward at times, though, because the order we start speaking doesn&#8217;t always line up with the order of messages as they&#8217;re sent.</p>\r\n<p>In email, this is less of an issue because there&#8217;s a longer gap between messages, but it can still be confusing on mailing lists when someone who doesn&#8217;t check their email obsessively is responding to a question that was asked yesterday and has already been answered several times and forgotten by the rest of the list.</p>\r\n<p>I&#8217;m particularly interested in this issue because I&#8217;m pretty awful at turn taking in face-to-face conversation. Things should be easiest with all the context of visual cues and body language indicating who is about to speak, but I have a hard time taking what should be my turns in conversation. People tell me I don&#8217;t talk much. Hmm&#8230; I wonder if anyone ever tells someone they don&#8217;t listen much.</p>\r\n<p>A long time ago I read that Ghandi, or maybe it was Buddha, would speak little so the few words had more impact. I remember thinking well of myself when I read that, but that&#8217;s entirely justification, not motivation, for my own speaking less. I failed my first driving test because I was too slow to pull out into traffic. If there were a conversation test, I&#8217;d fail that for the same reason.</p>\r\n<p>So anyway, that&#8217;s what got me thinking about turn negotiation in teleconferencing, and in the process, I think I came up with a decent idea for a business. The elevator pitch: it would be the American Idol model of user-selected media applied to teleconferencing.</p>\r\n<h4>Phone Idol?</h4>\r\n<p>So rather than calling and voting on contestants you watch on TV, you would call to vote on contestants you hear on the phone. You and another random person listen to each other for a span of time, maybe a minute, and then you each press a button on your phone to vote on how interesting the other person&#8217;s speech/song/whatever was.</p>\r\n<p>Then you move on and repeat this process for a few rounds until someone with something interesting to share has come out on top by social selection. Then everyone is patched in to hear the winning person do whatever they want to do on the teleconference for a minute or so. Rinse, and repeat.</p>\r\n<p>The winning audio clips could be recorded and published as a podcast to increase the incentive to participate. Ads could run on the teleconference, or maybe it would work with a 1-900 number. I&#8217;m sure someone with an MBA could work out the business model, but I think there&#8217;s a business there waiting to be made.</p>\r\n<p>Or maybe someone has already done something like this. I&#8217;ve never used one of those \"party lines.\" Are they anything like this, or is that more of a dating thing? I don&#8217;t suppose there are many original ideas of things to do with phones any more, but I thought it was interesting enough to write up.</p>','2006-07-29 18:09:54'),(862,'August 2nd Gig','<p>I\'ll be playing again at the Continental Lounge in Des Moines this Wednesday night from 9pm to 12am.

The owner of the Continental Lounge seems to like my music, so I expect to play there regularly, until I move. Which brings me to the other news:</p>\r\n<p>Jessica has a job that starts in a few weeks teaching at <a href=\"http://www.siuc.edu/\">Southern Illinois University</a>. It&#8217;s not all finalized yet, but it seems likely she&#8217;ll be leaving for Carbondale in a couple weeks. &#8220;But Scott,&#8221; you say, &#8220;SIU is in Carbondale, and your job is in Des Moines. How is that working?&#8221; It&#8217;s not really. Not yet, anyway. For now, I&#8217;m staying here in Des Moines while Jessica starts work in Carbondale. Interesting honeymoon, I know, but I&#8217;m confident it will work out.</p>\r\n<p>There&#8217;s a small chance Jessica will still find a good <abbr title=\"English as a Second Language\">ESL</abbr> teaching job in Des Moines, in which case I won&#8217;t move to Carbondale at all. There&#8217;s a slightly more likely scenario that I&#8217;ll find a job in Carbondale in the next few months and move there then. But neither job market seems very good for our respective vocations right now, so the most likely scenario seems to be that I&#8217;ll stay here until the end of the year, then join Jessica in Carbondale and <span style=\"text-decoration: line-through;\">be unemployed</span> do freelance work.</p>\r\n<p>So the next few months will double as both a stalling tactic in making a major transition and a chance to save up some money with both of us working full-time jobs at the same time before I no longer have steady income. It will also give me a chance to hone my musical skills if I am left with no choice but to become a world-famous musician for a living.</p>\r\n<p>It&#8217;s all rather up in the air right now, but worst case scenario: Jessica works full-time, I try to make more than I spend online, and we adopt a lower-cost lifestyle than we&#8217;ve been living lately.

And despite its presence in the Declaration of Independence, we know the signers didn\'t, in fact, regard all men as being created \"equal,\" and pretty much ignored women entirely. But, the virtue would supposedly be that it helped to create \"a new world,\" where men were more equal than in the old one. A \"flatter\" one, if you will. But again, there were more processes at work in that period in history than are captured in that one document, and there was, and remains, plenty of suffering to come in the effort to live up to the notion that \"all men are created equal.\" It doesn\'t come about because someone put it down on paper, nor is it necessary, but it helps certain other processes gain supporters and adherents.

I wasn&#8217;t alive when the song was written during the American invasion of Vietnam, but I know the war was not actually over, and I always wondered what kind of effect that had on the people, stating aspiration as fact. Surely the phrase \"all men are created equal\" has changed how we think about equality in America, and I think probably for the better.</p>\r\n<p>So while <q>the opportunity that anybody has to enjoy the same, or more. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s great about blogging</q> doesn&#8217;t appear to be helping anyone much, I don&#8217;t think all aspirations stated as fact are harmful. I&#8217;m not sure where the distinction is, but here&#8217;s a rough guess at what it might be:</p>\r\n<p>The signatories to the Declaration of Independence had something at stake (land claims) in bringing reality closer to their stated aspirations. The cheerleaders of weblogging, on the other hand, have something at stake (attention claims) in <em>preventing</em> reality from matching their stated aspirations.

Ethanol is an exciting prospect for a sustainable fuel source, but most people I talk to know this already, so I generally spend most of these conversations pointing out potential problems with ethanol.</p>\r\n<p>We tend to overlook potential problems when evaluating <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com_bubble\">something new that promises to solve existing problems</a>, and I get paid to promote ethanol, so I want to add some balance to my own small impact and these discussions by pointing out problems, e.g. ethanol is not polution-free, not all cars can run on ethanol-heavy fuel, and so on. But with all these problems in mind, ethanol is clearly much better than oil as a fuel source.</p>\r\n<p>The biggest problem seems to be that there&#8217;s just not enough ethanol to really replace oil. Whenever I point this out, someone asks me how much ethanol there is, and I say \"I don&#8217;t know.\" Today, I found out. Someone on <abbr title=\"National Public Radio\">NPR</abbr> said there&#8217;s enough corn-based ethanol to produce 15 billion gallons of fuel a year. That&#8217;s a small dent in the 140 billion gallons of oil we current use yearly.</p>\r\n<p>I also mention in these conversations that there might be ways of making ethanol other than corn. And then someone asks me more about those alternate ethanol sources, and I say \"I don&#8217;t know.\" Today, I found out this too. <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060907/BUSINESS01/60907023/1001/RSS01\">An article in the Des Moines Register</a> says <q>distilleries that can make fuel alcohol from crop waste, prairie grasses or trees rather than corn should be in operation within five years.</q></p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, the article doesn&#8217;t say how much fuel we can expect those distilleries to produce. I expect it&#8217;s nowhere near the 125 billion gallons needed to entirely replace oil. But I&#8217;m a little more hopeful than I was yesterday that between ethanol, solar, other technologies, and reduced consumption, the transition to a post-oil economy need not be very painful.</p>','2006-09-07 19:07:38'),(878,'Buy Me an Ounce','<p>Buy Me an Ounce (<a href=\"http://music.typewriting.org/mp3s/scott_reynen/buy_me_an_ounce.mp3\">MP3</a>, <a href=\"http://music.typewriting.org/lyrics/scott_reynen/buy_me_an_ounce\">lyrics</a>) is my third song (<a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2003/12/16/anyone_lived_in_a_pretty_how_town/\">one</a>, <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/06/17/next_to_of_course_god_america_i/\">two</a>) with lyrics from a poem by e. e. cummings.

I watched throughout the morning until it became clear to me what was happening.</p>\r\n<p>I had a few friends in New York, but I didn&#8217;t think first of them. My first thought was that this was Pearl Harbor and it was now the time to start preventing Hiroshima. I spent much of the next four years working to that end. I walked around campus in September 12 with the words \"the other cheek\" written on my face, in an effort to bring out the good in people and not the bad I feared was coming. I encouraged reconciliation and discouraged revenge. I helped organize multiple organizations focused on these goals.</p>\r\n<p>I drew attention to the innocent civilians dying as we bombed Afghanistan. I loudly opposed our invasion of Iraq. I made the front page of  newspapers. I made the TV news. I spoke on panels. I campaigned for politicians calling for peace. I campaigned against politicians calling for war. I compromised and voted for Kerry. I registered voters and served as an election judge to help others do the same.</p>\r\n<p><em>None of this worked</em>. I hope I made some small impact, but many more innocent people have died in the pursuit of vengence for the events of five years ago than died on that day. I didn&#8217;t hear they died on the radio.

I think BarCamp will be a good place to start. I have presented at and attended other conferences before on topics such as linguistics, gay rights, and general academic research, and I&#8217;ve read a lot about BarCamp and other tech conferences, so I think I have a pretty good idea of what I&#8217;m getting into.</p>\r\n<p>I seem to have done something recently that landed me on a to-be-invited-to-conferences list.

You could search for \"Bob\" and get a map of people named Bob, and all Bob has to do is basically wrap his address in class=\"adr\". That&#8217;s much easier than making your own Google Map, which is about as easy as it can be, or looking up your latitude and longitude, which is still needlessly cumbersome.</p>\r\n<p>And I&#8217;m still working on making this whole process run a little more smoothly for Bob and his once and future friends who want to find him on a map. But I will no longer be talking about this in any depth at BarCampMilwaukee. The planned leader of the microformats session can no longer make it, which left me with a sort of microformats 201 session missing a microformats 101 session. So I&#8217;m now leading the microformats session.</p>\r\n<p>That will be easy because I could explain <a href=\"http://microformats.org/\">microformats</a> in my sleep, and there seems to be more interest in the general concept of microformats than the geo stuff.

The characters aren&#8217;t particularly interesting, and the plot of the first episode was pretty standard high school drama. But I talked to Dan and his wife about it, and they suggested I give it a couple more shows before giving up on it. I just watched the third episode tonight and while my opinion hasn&#8217;t substantially changed, I expect I&#8217;ll keep watching.</p>\r\n<p>The individual plots of the second and third episodes were slightly more interesting than the first, but more important to keep my attention, there&#8217;s a more developed but still unresolved over-arching plot. Unfortunately the characters are still rather boring. The good guys are always good and the bad guys are always bad. Also, the kids are unbelievably mature.

(I thought I was all clever to note that the mic wasn&#8217;t working, only to discover I was the only person in the room who didn&#8217;t realize the mic was only for the video camera.) Not only is Flash 9 available as a free and unrestricted beta, but the new coding syntax is almost indistinguishable from Java, is tied into the open source <a href=\"http://www.eclipse.org/\">Eclipse <abbr title=\"Integrated Development Environment\">IDE</abbr></a>, can be styled with a slight variant of <abbr title=\"Cascading Style Sheets\">CSS</abbr>, and Flex interfaces look about as simple as XCode\'s drag and drop Interface Builder.

It may be a skewed sample, as one of those weddings was my own, but all of them lived together for years prior to marriage, and they were all pretty much \"married\" long before the wedding.

The ceremony looks and feels just as it would if the wedding was actually the marriage.

I suspect that&#8217;s because I&#8217;m a less dedicated fan. Dave has a well-developed understanding of the motivations of each character, but I&#8217;m conceptualizing them much more generally, and especially so after the long summer break.</p>\r\n<p>Some characters are generally good. Some characters are generally bad. Some characters are generally ambiguous. Some characters are civilians. Some characters are military. With the entire plot turned upside down, none of this has changed really. While Dave is expecting a more complex reason for Adama&#8217;s guilt, the thought hadn&#8217;t crossed my mind.</p>\r\n<p>At the end of season two, I was rather annoyed at the plot twist. After watching the premiere of season three, I&#8217;m still annoyed at it, but not for the reasons I was before (the plot is broken), nor for the reasons Dave seems to be. I&#8217;m now going to spoil both the plot twist and the season three premiere, so if you haven&#8217;t seen those and don&#8217;t like spoilers, stop here.</p>\r\n<p>&#8230;</p>\r\n<p>Now then, up until the end of season two, the analogies between the Battlestar Galactica universe and modern events here in reality were pretty obvious. Cylons, like terrorists, do not observe the moral boundaries the rest of us enjoy. Yet they look and act just like normal people. What are we to do? Kill them all! Hmm, that didn&#8217;t work so well. We better put some more thought into this. And that&#8217;s where we are at the end of season two: putting more thought into how to live in a world where anyone could be walking around holding a fundamentally different world view that threatens everything we hold dear, and we have no way of knowing it until it&#8217;s too late.</p>\r\n<p>At the end of season two, the cylon-terrorists suddenly win the war. They&#8217;re able to impose their world view on humanity, and everything changes. Now humanity is the terrorists, with suicide bombers to boot. New moral question: what would you do if you were an Iraqi? I don&#8217;t like this question because it&#8217;s not really that interesting. I don&#8217;t know exactly what I&#8217;d do, but I know I wouldn&#8217;t support suicide bombers. Maybe I&#8217;d feel differently if this wasn&#8217;t so entirely hypothetical, but it is. Iraqis are not watching Battlestar Galactica.</p>\r\n<p>The cylons are now playing the part of America in this analogy, and I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s not really working so far. As a viewer, am I supposed to feel empathy for the cylons? I feel more empathy for Bush. At least he has some vague plan, detached from reality as it is. But despite the chilling \"they have a plan\" conclusion of the Battlestar Galactica intro, by all appearances they don&#8217;t really. It turns out the world view they&#8217;re finally able to impose on humanity isn&#8217;t a world view at all. It&#8217;s a mish-mash of completely contradictory world views.</p>\r\n<p>Some of the cylons believe in peace; others want to destroy humanity. Some love humans; others hate them. It&#8217;s not so unbelievable that the cylons would contradict each other, but that any authoritarian regime would. I&#8217;m having a lot of trouble believing this mix of views was somehow able to come together to accomplish even the most mundane task, much less the subjugation of all of humanity. They&#8217;re voting! Genocidal maniacs don&#8217;t vote on exactly how much genocide to carry out. Suddenly I&#8217;ve lost my suspension of disbelief.</p>\r\n<p>So I&#8217;m no longer interested in the moral questions of Battlestar Galactica and I no longer believe the basic plot makes any sense, even granting the questionable science of it all. Why do I say I liked it more than Dave? Because the plot is unresolved, and my shallow attention to the show makes that unresolved plot compelling despite these other failings.</p>\r\n<p>I want the good guys to win. What began as a show appealing to my more refined philosophical side now appeals to my most basic interests. I won&#8217;t be very surprised if the cylons kill a puppy in the next episode just to dumb it down a little more for me and make me sympathize even with the suicide bombers in my desire for the good guys to win. And that&#8217;s not so bad, but I was expecting more.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe the show will grow more complex again. Maybe I really will start to question the ethics of suicide bombing. Maybe I&#8217;ll gradually forget that the cylons destroyed humanity and start to care about the problems they face trying to come to terms with their status as the sole remaining superpower. But I think it&#8217;s more likely I&#8217;ll instead spend the rest of Battlestar Galactica season three waiting for the good guys to win.</p>','2006-10-11 22:34:18'),(892,'Seeking a Contract Web Developer','<p>A while back <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/08/07/Regular_Wednesday_Night_Gigs%2C_Likely_Moving/\">I was presented with the possibility</a> that I might be moving to Carbondale at the end of the year, or I might not. I decided to take the copout and put off this decision as long as possible. Meanwhile I&#8217;ve been more actively seeking out contract work so that if I did end up moving to Carbondale, I&#8217;d at least have some sort of income.</p>\r\n<p>Last week Jessica finished her first term of teaching (half a semester), and she&#8217;s relatively happy with her job in Carbondale. Last week I also made more money from contract work than I did at my full time job. So I made a decision to definitely move to Carbondale. I&#8217;m not moving immediately because I have a lot I want to do before moving. In addition to packing up my life in Des Moines, I also have a lot of projects at work I&#8217;d rather not leave without completing. So I&#8217;m moving around the end of the year.</p>\r\n<p>But I&#8217;m probably not quitting my job at the end of the year. We haven&#8217;t worked out all the details, but I&#8217;ll likely be working remotely for a few months at least, doing pretty much what I do now in Des Moines, only doing it in Carbondale. On the down side, I expect it will be slightly more work for everyone involved to communicate strictly with no face to face contact. On the up side, I will no longer eat all the candy in the accounting department. And I can fold my laundry while I read my email. I do that anyway, but with personal email. Now I&#8217;ll get paid to do it.</p>\r\n<p>I&#8217;ll be happy to continue working on familiar projects with familiar people, but I&#8217;m also enjoying the freelance work I&#8217;ve been doing. It&#8217;s a good way to prioritize my seemingly endless interest in web development. Things people are willing to pay me to do tend to be more interesting than updating my existing unpaid web services whenever someone wants something more out of them. I&#8217;m tempted to pay someone to answer <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2004/12/26/myspace_RSS_feeds_to_save_time/\">the endless stream of comments on my original MySpace RSS post</a>.</p>\r\n<p>So this is all good. The problem, if it can be called a problem, is that I&#8217;m now facing a scenario of having too much paid work. I&#8217;ll definitely prioritize the steady work from my current employer, but I hate to entirely give up on the freelance stuff. I have a lot of stuff I&#8217;d like to do, and I often think it would be nice to pay someone else to do it. So that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do.</p>\r\n<p>I&#8217;m going to keep accepting as much freelance work as I can get doing projects that interest me, and I&#8217;m going to take the money I make from that and pay someone else to do other projects that interest me. So I&#8217;m looking to hire web developers (and less so designers) with interests similar to my own.</p>\r\n<p>What are those interests? Probably the main disqualifier is that I&#8217;m willing to do interesting work for little pay. I make more money than I need, not because I make a lot, but because I don\'t need a lot. And I expect anyone I hire to have a similar prioritizing of, say, <a href=\"http://makedatamakesense.com/\">making data make sense</a> over high income. Students would be good.</p>\r\n<p>Beyond that, I&#8217;m looking for developers who use technologies I use or at least that I&#8217;m interesting in learning. The former include PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, CSS, semantic HTML, and a few other odds and ends. The latter include Ruby on Rails, Python, PostgreSQL, Flash, and maybe Perl. Basically, ASP, Java, and ColdFusion coders need not apply. It would be nice if one had an  understanding of basic things like  binary and HTTP, but I don&#8217;t really want to get too picky about specific knowledge. I&#8217;m more interested in curiosity.</p>\r\n<p>So if you know anyone looking for some interesting web development work for reasonable but not extravagant income, please let me know.</p>','2006-10-12 21:40:40'),(893,'Tzedakah','<p>Via <a href=\"http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/55509#1462177\">a comment on MetaFilter</a>, I just learned about <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tzedakah#Levels_of_tzedakah\">the levels of tzedakah</a>, which I\'ll copy here from Wikipedia because I found it interesting:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Giving a poor person work (or loaning him money to start a business) so he will not have to depend on charity. This is because the person is now free from having to rely on charity. The giver has not just helped the recipient for the short while, but instead for the rest of their life. There are four sub-levels to this:\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Giving a poor person work.</li>\r\n<li>Making a partnership with them (this is lower than work, as the recipient might feel he doesn\'t put enough into the partnership).</li>\r\n<li>Giving a loan.</li>\r\n<li>Giving a gift.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</li>\r\n<li>Giving charity anonymously to an unknown recipient.</li>\r\n<li>Giving charity anonymously to a known recipient.</li>\r\n<li>Giving charity publicly to an unknown recipient.</li>\r\n<li>Giving charity before being asked.</li>\r\n<li>Giving adequately after being asked.</li>\r\n<li>Giving willingly, but inadequately.</li>\r\n<li>Giving unwillingly.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Especially so in the context of the Grameen Bank, which just <a href=\"http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2006/\">won the Nobel Peace Prize</a> today. The Grameen bank is level 1.3 of tzedakah. Back in the day, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Works_Progress_Administration\">the WPA was level 1.1</a>. But I&#8217;m not sure level 1.1 can really be instutionalized outside the context of economic catastrophe. Even the WPA was criticized for promoting laziness. People don&#8217;t like to feel lazy, and sometimes it&#8217;s nice to have incentives to live up to our potential. The Grameen Bank provides those incentives, so I think on the levels of tzedakah, it&#8217;s about as good as a large organization can get.</p>','2006-10-13 22:57:39'),(894,'Sleepy Laptop','<p>Last night I was chatting with <a href=\"http://www.josh-miller.com/\">my friend Josh</a> about <a href=\"http://www.josh-miller.com/flint/PICT0003.jpg\">his new puppy</a> when my computer suddenly went to sleep. At first I thought there was a power failure, but then I realized that my laptop has a battery, and then I noticed the sleep light was pulsing, so I pressed a key to wake it up.</p>\r\n<p>This morning it happened again. And then again. It seemed to become more and more frequent until I restarted my computer, and then it was fine. Until it went to sleep again. And then it wouldn&#8217;t wake up. So I tried to do a restart with ctl-apple-power, and that didn\'t work. So I tried to shut it down by holding down the power button, and that didn&#8217;t work. So I tried to shut it down by removing the power cord and the battery.</p>\r\n<p>That didn\'t even work. The sleep light continued to pulse despite the lack of any visible power source. I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a reserve battery in there somewhere, but I didn&#8217;t expect it to power the sleep pulse light. Eventually it died and I replaced the battery and the power cord and restarted and everything was fine. Until it happened again.</p>\r\n<p>Quick learner that I am, I started to realize this problem wasn&#8217;t going to go away. I decided to try to figure out what was going on before tomorrow when the help desk guys at work could look at it, in case it was no longer running tomorrow. Somewhere in there I had run disk utility and found no apparent problems with the hard disk, so I figured at worst the hard disk would need to be moved to a different machine. No data loss, no problem. But you never know.</p>\r\n<p>So I went searching online and found some information suggesting I should reset my Power Management Unit. So I followed <a href=\"http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=14449\">the instructions from Apple</a>, or at least I think I did. The process doesn&#8217;t include any indication of whether or not anything is actually happening. I might as well have been waving a crystal over my PowerBook for all I could tell I was doing.</p>\r\n<p>No spontaneous insomnia yet in the time it took me to type this.

After reading more, I found a suggestion to delete <code>/Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/[SomethingToDoWithPowerManagement].plist</code>. I&#8217;d tell you the actual file name, but it hasn&#8217;t reappeared yet. No sleepiness since, so I guess that&#8217;s okay.

By &#8220;independent voter,&#8221; I mean that I will give any candidate an opportunity to earn my vote, regardless of party affiliation. This seems like the common sense basis of democracy to me, but I don&#8217;t know many people who do this.</p>\r\n<p>In the past, I&#8217;ve asked a lot of a candidate wishing to earn my vote. Candidates had to somehow insert themselves into the various media I consume, e.g. radio, billboards, weblogs, showing up at my house, etc. If they failed to make themselves known to me, I voted based on what I knew of their opponent. If all candidates in a given race failed to do so, I voted based on a statistical correlation between party affiliation and my previous voting preferences. That is, I voted for Democrats because I tend to like Democrats.</p>\r\n<p>This last part doesn&#8217;t make me feel very independent, especially when this actually happens a lot. Most elections I vote in are minor local and regional offices and I know nothing about the individual candidates. This year I voted absentee (which anyone can do in Iowa and many other states), so I could take my time to research these candidates and avoid resorting to party affiliation guesswork for any of my votes.</p>\r\n<p>After many hours of researching, I&#8217;m happy to say I didn&#8217;t vote for anyone based on their party affiliation, but I did vote for a few based on something other than the information I was able to find. This is because I wasn&#8217;t able to find much information. So I applied my same criteria as before, only this time I was actively seeking out information.</p>\r\n<p>If I couldn&#8217;t find anything about a candidate in a Google search, I voted based on what I knew about the opposing candidates. And if I couldn&#8217;t find any information about any candidates in a race, I voted based on gender. That&#8217;s admittedly not the best way to vote, and maybe I should have just not voted at all in those races, but I&#8217;m comfortable taking that gamble in the interest of getting more women in elected offices of government. In any case, I managed to vote without preference to party, which is important to me. </p>\r\n<p>With that as my independent voting strategy, I will go through specifically who I voted for and why in the next few posts.</p>\r\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>','2006-10-16 21:44:40'),(896,'2006 Election: Governor','<div style=\"float: right; width: 200px; margin: 0 0 1em 1em;\" class=\"box\">\r\n	<h4 style=\"margin: 0;\">Election 2006</h4>\r\n	<ul style=\"padding-left: 1.5em; line-height: 1em;\">\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/16/2006_Election%3A_How_I_Voted/\">How I Voted</a></li>\r\n		<li>Governor</li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/17/Election_2006%3A_US_Representative/\">US Representative</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/17/Election_2006%3A_State_Auditor/\">State Auditor</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/18/Election_2006%3A_Secretary_of_State/\">Secretary of State</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/19/Election_2006%3A_Treasurer_of_State/\">Treasurer of State</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/23/Election_2006%3A_Secretary_of_Agriculture/\">Secretary of Agriculture</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/23/Election_2006%3A_Attorney_General/\">Attorney General</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/23/Election_2006%3A_State_Senator/\">State Senator</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/23/Election_2006%3A_State_Representative/\">State Representative</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/25/Election_2006%3A_Board_of_Supervisors/\">Board of Supervisors</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/25/Election_2006%3A_County_Treasurer/\">County Treasurer</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/25/Election_2006%3A_County_Recorder/\">County Recorder</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/29/Election_2006%3A_County_Attorney/\">County Attorney</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/29/Election_2006%3A_County_Public_Hospital_Trustee/\">County Public Hospital Trustee</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/29/Election_2006%3A__Soil_and_Water_Conservation_District_Commissioner/\">Soil and Water Conservation District Commissioner</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/29/Election_2006%3A_County_Agricultural_Extension_Council/\">County Agricultural Extension Council</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/29/Election_2006%3A_Judges/\">Judges</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/29/Election_2006%3A_Conclusion/\">Conclusion</a></li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>There are five candidates for Governor of Iowa, with Lieutenant Governor running on the same tickets so I chose them together. The first out of contention is Mary J. Martin, running in the Socialist Workers Party. She&#8217;s out because she has no website. There are some less important offices for which I&#8217;ll let a candidate  get by without a website, but not Governor.</p>\r\n<p>Next out is <a href=\"http://www.shrinkiowagov.org/governor.html\">Kevin Litten</a>, running in the Libertarian Party. His poorly designed website is lacking any information on specific issues, perhaps because he&#8217;s already given up, saying <q>I may not win this election.</q> Sorry Kevin, try a little harder next time. And then there were three.</p>\r\n<p>I don&#8217;t trust <a href=\"http://nussle.house.gov/\">Jim Nussle</a>, the Republican candidate for Governor. Specifically I don&#8217;t like his ambiguous position on abortion, which apparently <a href=\"http://www.hawkeyegop.com/2006/09/nussle_on_abort.html\">bothers people on the other side of the issue as well</a>. I can understand the desire to ban all abortion. I think it&#8217;s mistaken, but an honest mistake. But Jim Nussle seems to be hiding his real position, and that&#8217;s why he lost my vote.</p>\r\n<p>The remaining to candidates for Iowa Governor are <a href=\"http://www.chetculver.com/\">Chet Culver</a>, on the Democratic Party ticket, and <a href=\"http://www.votewendy.org/\">Wendy S. Barth</a>, on the Green Party ticket. Barth looks much better. She has clear positions on important issues, and in general I agree with those positions. Culver, on the other hand, takes vaguely agreeable positions on popular issues. If I was the only one voting in this election, I would have voted for Barth.</p>\r\n<p>But I looked at the polls and saw that Culver and Nussle were in a statistical tie, so I filled in Culver&#8217;s oval as a strategic vote against Nussle. Sorry Green Party. The day after I filled in this oval, a new poll came out with Culver ahead by 7%. In retrospect, I should have waited until closer to the election to fill in my ballot at all. But it&#8217;s done now, and I voted for Culver for Governor.</p>\r\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>','2006-10-17 00:08:45'),(921,'Knowing Names','<p>A few weeks ago, my sister-in-law was re-married in the Catholic church.

This is the first race involving <a href=\"http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?Category=NEWS&amp;theme=JOB_TRAINING_EXECUTIVES&amp;template=theme\">the CIETC scandal</a>. Apparently a lot of money went into the Central Iowa Employment and Training Consortium, and not a lot of employment and training came out. Ako Abdul-Samad, running as a Democrat, was on the CIETC board, and didn&#8217;t convince me that he was innocent of the <a href=\"http://www.dmregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060801/NEWS10/608010384/1001&amp;lead=1\">corruption charges</a> being tossed at him. He lost my vote.</p>\r\n<p>Jack Whitver, running as a Republican, successfully lost my vote by <a href=\"http://whotv.com/Global/story.asp?S=5430717\">showing up at Abdul-Samad&#8217;s house after being told Abdul-Samad was unavailable due to family illness</a>. Even assuming charitably that Abdul-Samad was lying about the family illness, that still makes Whitver a political moron.</p>\r\n<p>Luckily I have two other candidates in this race. Brett Blanchfield, running as a Libertarian, gets points for being the only candidate to bother answering <a href=\"	http://www.growthevote.org/php.asp?g=iowa&amp;page=Candidate_Guide&amp;legdistrictid=1944\r\n\">a candidate survey from the Iowa Prosperity Project</a>. And he also gets points for <a href=\"http://www.shrinkiowagov.org/district66.html\">living just a few houses down from me</a>. But he&#8217;s campaigning on issues like <a href=\"http://blanchfield66.blogspot.com/2006/10/blanchfield-begins-radio-advertising.html\">repealing the mandatory seatbelt law</a>. I can sympathize with the general libertarian desire to streamline government, but if seatbelts are the first (or second, or even twentieth) place a candidate identifies waste in government, he&#8217;s lost my vote.</p>\r\n<p>That leaves only Jeff Johannsen. Lucky for me, Johannsen looks like a candidate for whom I can vote without reservation. He <q>wants to help make health insurance more available and affordable to small businesses and neighborhoods [...] to increase availability of assisted living to those with low to moderate incomes [...] to promote the cleanup of neighborhoods and discourages urban sprawl,</q> according to the <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/99999999/NEWS09/60626013\">Des Moines Register</a>. That all sounds good to me, so I voted for Johannsen.</p>\r\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>','2006-10-23 21:20:58'),(906,'Election 2006: Board of Supervisors','<div style=\"float: right; width: 200px; margin: 0 0 1em 1em;\" class=\"box\">\r\n	<h4 style=\"margin: 0;\">Election 2006</h4>\r\n	<ul style=\"padding-left: 1.5em; line-height: 1em;\">\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/16/2006_Election%3A_How_I_Voted/\">How I Voted</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/17/2006_Election%3A_Governor/\">Governor</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/17/Election_2006%3A_US_Representative/\">US Representative</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/17/Election_2006%3A_State_Auditor/\">State Auditor</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/18/Election_2006%3A_Secretary_of_State/\">Secretary of State</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/19/Election_2006%3A_Treasurer_of_State/\">Treasurer of State</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/23/Election_2006%3A_Secretary_of_Agriculture/\">Secretary of Agriculture</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/23/Election_2006%3A_Attorney_General/\">Attorney General</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/23/Election_2006%3A_State_Senator/\">State Senator</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/23/Election_2006%3A_State_Representative/\">State Representative</a></li>\r\n		<li>Board of Supervisors</li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/25/Election_2006%3A_County_Treasurer/\">County Treasurer</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/25/Election_2006%3A_County_Recorder/\">County Recorder</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/29/Election_2006%3A_County_Attorney/\">County Attorney</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/29/Election_2006%3A_County_Public_Hospital_Trustee/\">County Public Hospital Trustee</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/29/Election_2006%3A__Soil_and_Water_Conservation_District_Commissioner/\">Soil and Water Conservation District Commissioner</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/29/Election_2006%3A_County_Agricultural_Extension_Council/\">County Agricultural Extension Council</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/29/Election_2006%3A_Judges/\">Judges</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/29/Election_2006%3A_Conclusion/\">Conclusion</a></li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>I don&#8217;t know what exactly the Board of Supervisors supervises, but this is another interesting race. The two candidates are John F. Mauro, running as a Democrat, and Gene Phillips, on the ballot by petition. This happens to be the <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2006608240390\">fourth time</a> these two candidates have run against each other. In the 1998 Democratic primary, Mauro won by less than three hundred votes. Then Phillips ran as an independent in the general election and won, also by less than three hundred votes. Then in 2002, Mauro ran against Phillips again and won, this time by a substantial margin.</p>\r\n<p>So Mauro is the incumbent and he won last time. But he&#8217;s also on the CIETC board, and although he doesn&#8217;t have the direct connection to corruption that <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/23/Election_2006%3A_State_Representative/\">Abdul-Samad appears to have</a>, it doesn&#8217;t really look good for anyone on that board. Mauro&#8217;s best response to the attention was <q>Hopefully, they won\'t hold me responsible for something I didn\'t have any control over.</q></p>\r\n<p>Well, I do hold him responsible for the lack of control. And it&#8217;s also Phillips&#8217; turn to win.

Tim Brien is the incumbent, but he lost the primary to Julie M. Haggerty. As I mentioned <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/18/Election_2006%3A_Secretary_of_State/\">earlier</a>, he <a href=\"http://desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060624/NEWS05/606240322/1001\">intially blamed Michael Mauro</a>, Commissioner of Elections, implying that he rigged the election. But then he <a href=\"http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060806/NEWS05/608060347/-1/archive\">dropped his challenge</a>, saying he didn&#8217;t believe he could get a fair result.</p>\r\n<p>Apparently he does think he can get a fair result in the general election, even though Michael Mauro is still Commissioner of Elections, because he&#8217;s running as an independent. So I don&#8217;t trust Tim Brien, and this distrust makes me like Michael Mauro and Julie M. Haggerty more.</p>\r\n<p>The third candidate is <a href=\"http://www.chrishagenow.com/\">Christopher D. Hagenow</a>, running as a Republican. If you follow that link to his website, and the link from there to <a href=\"http://hagenowforrecorder.blogspot.com/\">his blog</a>, you&#8217; notice he doesn&#8217;t talk about issues much, and he seems as interested in the Nussle for Governor campaign as his own. As I mentioned in <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/17/2006_Election%3A_Governor/\">my discussion of the Governor race</a>, I don&#8217;t trust Nussle, so by association, I distrust Hagenow.</p>\r\n<p>If it wasn&#8217;t already obvious, I voted for Julie M. Haggerty for County Recorder.</p>\r\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>','2006-10-25 23:12:38'),(909,'Election 2006: County Attorney','<div style=\"float: right; width: 200px; margin: 0 0 1em 1em;\" class=\"box\">\r\n	<h4 style=\"margin: 0;\">Election 2006</h4>\r\n	<ul style=\"padding-left: 1.5em; line-height: 1em;\">\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/16/2006_Election%3A_How_I_Voted/\">How I Voted</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/17/2006_Election%3A_Governor/\">Governor</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/17/Election_2006%3A_US_Representative/\">US Representative</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/17/Election_2006%3A_State_Auditor/\">State Auditor</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/18/Election_2006%3A_Secretary_of_State/\">Secretary of State</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/19/Election_2006%3A_Treasurer_of_State/\">Treasurer of State</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/23/Election_2006%3A_Secretary_of_Agriculture/\">Secretary of Agriculture</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/23/Election_2006%3A_Attorney_General/\">Attorney General</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/23/Election_2006%3A_State_Senator/\">State Senator</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/23/Election_2006%3A_State_Representative/\">State Representative</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/25/Election_2006%3A_Board_of_Supervisors/\">Board of Supervisors</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/25/Election_2006%3A_County_Treasurer/\">County Treasurer</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/25/Election_2006%3A_County_Recorder/\">County Recorder</a></li>\r\n		<li>County Attorney</li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/29/Election_2006%3A_County_Public_Hospital_Trustee/\">County Public Hospital Trustee</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/29/Election_2006%3A__Soil_and_Water_Conservation_District_Commissioner/\">Soil and Water Conservation District Commissioner</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/29/Election_2006%3A_County_Agricultural_Extension_Council/\">County Agricultural Extension Council</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/29/Election_2006%3A_Judges/\">Judges</a></li>\r\n		<li><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/10/29/Election_2006%3A_Conclusion/\">Conclusion</a></li>\r\n	</ul>\r\n</div>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.ndaa-apri.org/ndaa/profile/john_p_sarcone_jan_feb_2006.html\">John P.

From a single document, I was able to see what dozens of lawyers thought about every judge in the state. The votes for retention are very high in general, so I set my bar at 90%. If more than 90% of the responding lawyers voted to retain a given judge, I did the same. If less than 90% of lawyers voted to retain, I voted against.</p>\r\n<p>As a result, I voted for retention on Anuradha Vaitheswaran, Van D. Zimmer, John C. Miller, Eliza J. Ovrom, Artis I.

A few people have commented to me that I&#8217;m putting a lot of work into my votes here. It probably shouldn&#8217;t take this much work to vote thoughtfully, as candidates would ideally be forthcoming with clear positions on issues. But voting thoughtfully also shouldn&#8217;t be exceptional enough that it&#8217;s worth a comment. Unfortunately, voting itself is still exceptional in America.</p>\r\n<p>In my fantasy America, election day is a national holiday during which we celebrate living democracy. Businesses would shut down and we&#8217;d have nothing better to do than to vote thoughtfully. We&#8217;d all have election day parties, at which showing up without an \"I voted\" sticker would be like showing up at a Halloween party without a costume, or showing up at a birthday party without a gift.</p>\r\n<p>But until that happens, this is the democracy we have, and these are the ovals I filled in on my ballot. Now who are you voting for? And why?</p>\r\n<div class=\"clear\"></div>','2006-10-29 19:13:45'),(919,'Lessons From My Grandfathers','<p>A while back I was thinking about my grandfathers. I believe I was listening to some radio program in which a man was sharing a memory of his grandfather. Both of my grandfathers are dead, and I remember very little about them. I <em>know</em> a lot more about them than I actually <em>remember</em>, from stories others have told me or pictures I&#8217;ve seen. But I think what I remember is more interesting. I remember two things about both of my grandfathers.</p>\r\n<p>My mother&#8217;s father was Charles Weaver. The first thing I remember about him is puzzles. We did puzzles together. Big puzzles with small pieces. They took a long time, and being a kid, I did very little of the work. Usually the puzzles were completed by my grandfather late one night as I slept. But he&#8217;d always leave out one piece, so when I woke in the morning, I had that satisfaction of completing the puzzle, even though I didn&#8217;t do the work. So my grandfather Weaver taught me to be lazy.</p>\r\n<p>The second thing I remember is that he wouldn&#8217;t repeat himself. He would say something when I wasn&#8217;t listening, and I would say &#8220;what?&#8221; and he just wouldn&#8217;t respond. I think he explained this once as an attempt to encourage listening. Or maybe that was just how I thought of it &#8212; I&#8217;m not sure. Either way, this taught me not to let my principles turn me into a jerk, a lesson I apply less consistantly than laziness.</p>\r\n<p>My father&#8217;s father was Cornelius Reynen. He was a minister, but I don&#8217;t remember him ministering in any professional capacity. I think maybe he had retired by the time I was born. I do remember two things about him that revolved around his ministry. The first was the post-dinner Bible readings at his house. My brothers and I were expected to sit around the table after the meal while he read to us from the Bible.</p>\r\n<p>I don&#8217;t think it was even the interesting stories either &#8212; just whatever happened to come next. Sometimes he would ask us questions at the end to make sure we were paying attention. It was a horrible experience for a child. But from it, I learned how to never be bored, by thinking.</p>\r\n<p>My second memory of this grandfather was <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rummikub\">Rummikub</a>, which my family would play with him in the evening. If you&#8217;re not familiar with Rummikub, it&#8217;s almost exactly like Rummy, only with tiles instead of cards. You might ask: why would anyone bother with tiles instead of cards? Well, because playing cards are evil, naturally.</p>\r\n<p>Granted, there are some slight differences between Rummy and Rummikub that make playing with tiles a little easier. But Cornelius, my grandfather, wasn&#8217;t interested in those differences, as far as I could tell. He was interested in avoiding cards because he was raised with and maintained the idea that playing cards are evil. So from playing Rummikub I learned to keep faith bounded by reason.</p>\r\n<p>That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s all I remember. I wish there were more, but given the small amount of time I spent with my grandfathers, I think these are pretty good lessons to take away. They&#8217;ve served me well so far. When I die some day, I hope the lessons <em>I</em> unintentionally pass down will be so useful.</p>','2006-11-12 16:06:17'),(916,'Election Day','<p>On the off chance that someone stumbled upon this unaware that Nov. 7, 2006 is an election day, it is.

I don&#8217;t think she ever had it legally changed or anything, but she started asking people to call her &#8220;Dora,&#8221; and we did. And suddenly she was &#8220;Dora,&#8221; and people would mention &#8220;Becca,&#8221; and I wouldn&#8217;t know who they were talking about, and then they&#8217;d say, &#8220;You know, Becca-Dora.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>I never heard an explanation of what brought about this desire to change her name. I think I asked her and she said something like &#8220;just because.&#8221; At the time, we were both studying existentialism, I as a casual student, and Becca-Dora as a philosophy major in the middle of writing a senior thesis on &#8220;Freedom and Facticity.&#8221; I couldn&#8217;t tell you what &#8220;Freedom and Facticity&#8221; means exactly, but at the time I suspected that had something to do with the name change. It seemed a sort of philosophy-in-action demonstration of how much we define our selves. If you want to be Dora, it turns out you can just start being Dora.</p>\r\n<p>But at some point after we graduated, Dora decided she wanted to be Becca again, and so everyone called her Becca again. And now Dora is just a vague idea of &#8230; something. Whatever the reason was for Dora, I can only assume from the later reversal that it wasn&#8217;t a very good reason to change names.</p>\r\n<p>My uncle, on the other hand, had what I think is a very good reason to change his name, but he never did. I didn&#8217;t hear this story until I was old enough to think it was odd that no one had told me earlier. But here it is: my grandparents&#8217; first child was named &#8220;Kenneth Eugene.&#8221; This child died three days after birth. Then they had another child, and they named him &#8230; &#8220;Kenneth Eugene.&#8221; This second Kenneth Eugene is my uncle Ken.</p>\r\n<p>So that&#8217;s weird, right? I&#8217;m pretty sure I would change my name if I found out I was named after my dead older brother. But I almost changed my name because it&#8217;s hard to spell, so I&#8217;m probably not the best person to judge what would be a good reason to change one&#8217;s name. Most people never change their names, but are there any social norms for those who do? I don&#8217;t see any. It&#8217;s name-changing anarchy out there. Anyone can do it, and no one does. Maybe that&#8217;s what &#8220;Freedom and Facticity&#8221; means.</p>','2006-11-16 06:07:15'),(923,'Tag Cloud','<p>In case you were wondering what I tend to write about here, I just made what the web geeks call <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/tag/\">a &#8220;tag cloud&#8221; for these articles</a>.

INSERT INTO `article` VALUES (924,'Middle Names','<p>My sister-in-law, the one who was <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/11/14/Knowing_Names/#content\">recently re-married</a> in the Catholic church, is pregnant. Does it count as a shotgun wedding if you&#8217;re already married with children? Anyway, after her re-wedding ceremony, at the party where <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/11/14/Knowing_Names/#content\">Ward pondered deep questions of names and knowing</a>, people were talking about names for the upcoming child. Several names were suggested, and most discarded. But all of the suggestions were first names. They hadn&#8217;t moved on to middle names yet.</p>\r\n<p>Patrick, the soon-to-be older brother, is pretty sure the child is going to be a boy. His logic is that he already has two sisters, so a boy is required to even out the gender imbalance. This boy has a future in statistics. He doesn&#8217;t quite understand middle names though. His middle name is &#8220;Julius,&#8221; and when he&#8217;s in trouble, he&#8217;s &#8220;Patrick Julius,&#8221; so he&#8217;s familiar with his own middle name.</p>\r\n<p>But as the first names were suggested at the party, Patrick tried them out by testing what he assumed would be the full name of this boy. &#8220;John&#8221; became &#8220;John Julius Namoff.&#8221; &#8220;Robert&#8221; became &#8220;Robert Julius Namoff.&#8221; It soon became clear that Patrick thought all boys in his family will have the same middle name.</p>\r\n<p>When he was younger, Patrick&#8217;s cousin Alex apparently had a different confusion about middle names. He once thought he had two middle names, &#8220;Ander&#8221; and &#8220;Michael.&#8221; Because when he was in trouble, his mother would say what he heard as &#8220;Alex Ander Michael,&#8221; actually &#8220;Alexander Michael.&#8221; Silly kids.</p>\r\n<p>But middle names are clearly counter-intuitive. Why do we have them? <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_name\">Wikipedia offers a few reasons</a>, but none of them seem worth the trouble. I think if I have a child to name, I&#8217;ll lobby hard for no middle name. If they grow up and find they don&#8217;t have enough names, they can always add more later. But I don&#8217;t really need to establish a line of royal ancestry or anything, so I don&#8217;t see any reason to give a child a third name before they have a personality to attach it to.</p>\r\n<p>My friend JJ recently gave me an additional name. A while back, I made the mistake of <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2005/03/20/Asperger%27s/\">talking about my self-diagnosis of Asperger&#8217;s</a>. Shortly after that, JJ introduced me to another friend of his, also named Scott. To differentiate between us, he has since referred to me and introduced me as his &#8220;autistic friend Scott.&#8221; So to JJ&#8217;s friends, my middle name is effectively &#8220;autistic.&#8221; Lucky for me, anyone who knows JJ just passes right over this as we meet.</p>\r\n<p>I have a similar additional name for JJ, but mine is non-verbal. Whenever I talk about JJ with people who have met him, I make sure to clarify exactly who I&#8217;m discussing by moving my hands around where my hair would be if it were as large as JJ&#8217;s. So his middle name is effectively a hand motion about four inches from the head.</p>\r\n<p>My \"autistic\" name has a small problem: I&#8217;m not actually autistic. And JJ&#8217;s hand-wavey name has a problem whenever he gets a haircut. But I think these ad hoc additions to our family and given names are far superior to middle names. I think that&#8217;s enough about names for now.

Then I thought &#8220;well, all those kids over at YouTube seem to get away with that by putting song in video, so it would be more pain to extract it than it would be worth.</p>\r\n<p>So I made a video of the song with images from Flickr licensed under Creative Commons attribution.

Before this week, I hadn&#8217;t read a book in at least a year. I read a lot, but not books. I spend much of my time reading articles online from a wide variety of sources. And I periodically listen to audio books. But there&#8217;s some small niche of media that only really works in a book. Articles can&#8217;t possibly develop ideas in the same depth, and audio books always leave less room for imagination with the reader&#8217;s tone heavily influencing interpretation.</p>\r\n<p>So I&#8217;m going to start reading books again, and the first book was <cite><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Beautiful-World-Kino-No-Tabi/dp/1598164554/\">Kino No Tabi</a></cite>. This book was lent to me by my librarian friend Libby, who read it before me. It was a good transition from my previous all-article reading diet to a new book-inclusive meal plan because it&#8217;s both relatively short and broken up into small chapters that could easily be read as independent stories.</p>\r\n<p><cite>Kino No Tabi</cite> was originally Japanese, but I read the English translation. I took Japanese back in university, so I can tell you that the title means \"Kino of Tabi.\" Kino is the name of the main character, and I&#8217;m not sure what \"Tabi\" means. It might be some conjugation of the word \"eat.\" I&#8217;m not sure.</p>\r\n<p>Anyway, the story is basically that Kino rides a motorcycle from city to city and has different adventures in each city. Also, the motorcycle talks. That&#8217;s the kind of thing that would be incredibly distracting in a movie or audio book, but doesn&#8217;t seem very strange in the book. Without going into too much detail the adventures in each city are the kind of simple stories that reflect some larger idea about life in general.</p>\r\n<p>Basically, <cite>Kino No Tabi</cite> is <cite>The Little Prince</cite>, only not as long, nor as good. I was interested enough to read to the end, but I don&#8217;t expect to read the next in the series. Oh yeah, there&#8217;s a series, called <cite>The Beautiful World</cite>. I don&#8217;t know if the second book has been translated to English yet or not.</p>\r\n<p>Since I last read a book over a year ago, I learned that I don&#8217;t need to finish everything I start reading. That&#8217;s common sense, of course, but I never really learned it until I had too many articles in my aggregator and too many other things I wanted to do. I finally started reading things until I was no longer interested and then closing them, without the feeling I once had that I was missing out on something important by not finishing what I&#8217;d started.</p>\r\n<p>So now I&#8217;m ready to apply that lesson to books. And while I won&#8217;t given an especially positive review of <cite>Kino No Tabi</cite>, it should say something that I finished it. It was good enough to finish but not good enough to continue the series. Let&#8217;s call that five out of ten stars, as a reference point for my future book reviews. Next up: <cite>The Omnivore&#8217;s Dilemma</cite>, which I won in the first annual Weaver family Christmas-in-November book exchange bingo tournament. Everyone won a book &#8212; more peer pressure to read books.</p>','2006-11-29 18:09:02'),(928,'Concentration','<p>This evening I heard the phrase &#8220;concentration camp&#8221; on <abbr title=\"National Public Radio\">NPR</abbr> and starting thinking about what that phrase means. In common use, &#8220;concentrate&#8221; is both a noun and a verb. Juice comes in a concentrate, it\'s pushed together in a small space. Or students are told to concentrate, to focus on what they should be doing. Either of these are an incredible euphemism for Nazi death camps, but which euphemism have we adopted? Do concentration camps concentrate people? Do they force people to concentrate? Do they concentrate death? And why is there an English-language euphemism for an atrocity carried out by Germans anyway?</p>\r\n<p>The answer to the latter question, from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Boer_War#The_concentration_camps\">Wikipedia</a>: the term &#8220;concentration camp&#8221; was first used to describe British internment camps in the Second Boer War. After gold was discovered Transvaal, British citizens flocked to the country, where they found the native population less than hospitable. To secure the rights of their own resource-exploiting citizens, the British entered a war against a Boer insurgency.</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>The conditions in the camps were very unhealthy and the food rations were meager. The wives and children of men who were still fighting were given smaller rations than others. The poor diet and inadequate hygiene led to endemic contagious diseases such as measles, typhoid and dysentery. Coupled with a shortage of medical facilities, this led to large numbers of deaths &#8212; a report after the war concluded that 27,927 Boers (of whom 22,074 were children under 16) and 14,154 black Africans had died of starvation, disease and exposure in the concentration camps</p></blockquote>\r\n<div style=\"float: right; margin: 1em 0 1em 1em;\">\r\n<img src=\"http://typewriting.org/image/article/content/boer_concentration_camp.gif\" alt=\"Child in concentration camp of Second Boer War\" />\r\n<p class=\"caption\">Photo from <a href=\"http://www.boer.co.za/boerwar/hellkamp.htm\">Hennie Barnard&#8217;s <cite>The Concentration Camps</cite></a></p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>So when the Germans later rounded up a group of people they didn&#8217;t like and started killing them, the phrase &#8220;concentration camp&#8221; was used because it had already been used as a euphemism for similar British atrocities. On top of the story of a superpower invading another country to control its natural resources, the word &#8220;insurgency&#8221; particular caught my attention here, with thoughts of the insurgency in Iraq. Were concentration camps a standard means of fighting insurgencies?</p>\r\n<p>Indeed they were. The <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_concentration_and_internment_camps\">list of concentration camps throughout history</a> is full of attempts to contain insurgent populations during armed invasions. Most recently, in 2001 the Russian military gathered up twenty thousand men and boys in Chechnia. Over 80% died. More immediately, the US military continues to entertain the idea of registering and rationing food to Iraqi residents, in the interest of controlling the insurgent population.</p> \r\n<p>Lieutenant Colonel James S. Corum of the US Army recently wrote about various strategies for dealing with insurgencies, in the context of possible application to America&#8217;s military activities in Iraq, in <cite><a href=\"http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/pub666.pdf\">FIGHTING INSURGENTS--NO SHORTCUTS TO SUCCESS</a></cite> [PDF, 3kb]:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>International law and the traditional rules of war allow for some very firm tactics employed to coerce and control populations. For example, to cut off support for rebels in pro-insurgent districts, Kitson advocated that government forces commandeer and carefully control all food stocks. Food was rationed by the police and army only to registered village residents, and whole villages would be cordoned off to prevent extra food from being brought in. <em style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;\">If the villagers wanted to give food to the rebels, they could do so only if they starved themselves</em>. The British also figured that, if the insurgents came in the night and took the peoples&#8217; carefully rationed food, people would eventually inform on the insurgents rather than face hunger. Such tactics were not only \r\neffective, but also legal.</p>\r\n<p>The good thing about Kitson&#8217;s approach to waging a counterinsurgency campaign \r\nstrictly within the rule of law is that it generally works. <em style=\"font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;\">The downside is that such an approach to counterinsurgency and intelligence takes a long time</em>, and success is measured not in any dramatic terms but in small, local, and incremental victories. It should be no surprise that some of our intelligence personnel and leaders might instinctively opt for the Trinquier approach with its promise of quick and decisive results, when our military doctrine is filled with adjectives such as &#8220;rapid&#8221; and &#8220;decisive&#8221; to describe the American mode of warfare. Yet the traditionally successful counterinsurgency doctrines are peppered with adjectives such as &#8220;methodical,&#8221; &#8220;systematic,&#8221; and &#8220;long-term.&#8221;</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Emphasis added. The downside of internment under threat of starvation, according to the US Army&#8217;s assessment, is not that it&#8217;s morally reprehensible; it just takes a long time to starve people to death. Our national unwillingness to concentrate on the &#8220;victory&#8221; some would imagine in Iraq has prevented us from establishing concentration camps. May our impatience save our souls.</p>','2006-11-30 18:08:34'),(929,'Protein','<p>A few days ago, I got a new laptop from work. It&#8217;s a MacBook Pro, and I really like it. I&#8217;ve moved all of my old files and applications over from my old laptop, checked that everything is working okay, installed Parallels to use for testing in Internet Explorer, and played Minesweeper in Windows XP. With all of those important tasks out of the way, I started playing with a new application that came on the new laptop: <a href=\"http://plasq.com/comiclife\">Comic Life</a>.</p>\r\n<p>As the name suggests, Comic Life makes it easy to make comic strips. It&#8217;s a lot of fun to use, and my first completed comic, previously destined to be an article with far too many words and too few pictures, is below.</p>\r\n<img src=\"http://typewriting.org/image/article/content/comic/protein/page_1.jpg\" alt=\"Comic: Protein: page 1\" />\r\n<img src=\"http://typewriting.org/image/article/content/comic/protein/page_2.jpg\" alt=\"Comic: Protein: page 2\" />\r\n<p>This was inspired by <a href=\"http://dontoearth.blogspot.com/2006/11/cannibals-all-or-you-eat-what-you-are.html\">an article on Don to Earth</a> (and many conversations I&#8217;ve had about protein).

And working for an advertising agency that previously represented the ethanol industry and continues to represent ethanol-related businesses causes the topic to come up in conversation for me more often than for the average Iowan even. I use ethanol in my car, as does most anyone who hasn&#8217;t put much thought into it. It&#8217;s commonly six cents cheaper. Who wouldn&#8217;t go with six cents cheaper?</p>\r\n<p>Well, I&#8217;ve talked to a few people who wouldn&#8217;t go with six cents cheaper. Their logic comes down to efficiency. While ethanol is cheaper, it actually takes your car more ethanol to produce the same amount of energy, so you&#8217;re getting few miles-per-gallon with ethanol vs. standard unleaded gas. &#8220;Meh,&#8221; I told myself, &#8220;that&#8217;s a worthwhile tradeoff for a cleaner planet.&#8221; Then the ethanol dissenters typically suggest that the process of creating ethanol actually creates more pollution. After a few of these conversations, I decided to do some testing and find out the truth by the numbers.</p>\r\n<p>82% of statistics are made up, so I set out to make up my own, in the only context that matters to me: my own car, a 1997 Buick LeSabre. Lacking the resources to test the pollution from my car (much less the processing plant at which my ethanol was produced), I decided to test what I could: the fuel efficiency of ethanol. Over the past couple months I&#8217;ve been recording all of my gas purchases, as well as my mileage between them.</p>\r\n<p>The process of figuring out miles-per-gallon was actually a bit confusing to me at first, so I&#8217;ll explain it here. When I fill up my tank, I reset my trip odometer. On my next refill, I know how many miles I&#8217;ve gone while emptying my tank, and the amount I put in to refill the tank is equal to the amount of gas I must have used while traveling those miles, because a full tank is always the same size. So by dividing those miles by those gallons, I have a miles-per-gallon number.</p>\r\n<p>This gets confusing when testing different types of gas, because the number of gallons on my current fill-up is actually the number of gallons used with the previous fill-up&#8217;s type of gas. I repeated this process several times, and attempted to get as close to a full tank as possible to avoid the previous tank skewing the efficiency of the current tank as I switched back and forth between 10% ethanol and 0% ethanol unleaded gas.</p>\r\n<p>So that&#8217;s my methodology. Here are the numbers:</p>\r\n<table class=\"shaded\">\r\n	<thead>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<th>Ethanol %</th>\r\n			<th>Gallons</th>\r\n			<th>Miles</th>\r\n			<th>Highway/City</th>\r\n			<th>Miles-per-gallon</th>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</thead>\r\n	<tbody>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>10%</td>\r\n			<td>15.056</td>\r\n			<td>393.7</td>\r\n			<td>Highway</td>\r\n			<td>26.149</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>0%</td>\r\n			<td>15.488</td>\r\n			<td>359.2</td>\r\n			<td>Highway</td>\r\n			<td>23.192</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>0%</td>\r\n			<td>14.571</td>\r\n			<td>257.0</td>\r\n			<td>City</td>\r\n			<td>17.637</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>0%</td>\r\n			<td>15.813</td>\r\n			<td>416.6</td>\r\n			<td>Highway</td>\r\n			<td>26.345</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>10%</td>\r\n			<td>14.923</td>\r\n			<td>370.3</td>\r\n			<td>Highway</td>\r\n			<td>24.814</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>0%</td>\r\n			<td>11.318</td>\r\n			<td>293.5</td>\r\n			<td>Highway</td>\r\n			<td>25.932</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n		<tr>\r\n			<td>0%</td>\r\n			<td>16.497</td>\r\n			<td>371.0</td>\r\n			<td>City</td>\r\n			<td>22.488</td>\r\n		</tr>\r\n	</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>Notice that I added a Highway/City driving variable to the data. I quickly noticed that my numbers weren&#8217;t nearly as steady as I was expecting, and I believe my hunch that this variance is primary due to highway vs. city driving is borne out by the numbers above. So the first conclusion is that any variance in efficiency between ethanol and non-ethanol gas is much smaller than the variance between city and highway driving. Those of us concerned about fuel-efficiency need to be working to make our cities more hospitable to walking and biking more than we need to be debating the merits of ethanol. Nonetheless, on to debating the merits of ethanol.</p>\r\n<p>It&#8217;s clear to me from the numbers above that ethanol is indeed less fuel efficient than non-ethanol gas in my car. However, the difference is very slight, and it is more than offset by the standard price difference of six cents per gallon. Figuring that in, the average miles-per-dollar figures (for highway miles only, as I&#8217;m still finishing my tank of city-driving ethanol) are: 12.74 for ethanol and 12.21 for non-ethanol. So despite the lower fuel efficiency of ethanol, the price difference means that for every dollar I spend, I&#8217;m going <em>more</em> miles by using ethanol in my car. With this in mind, I intend to continue using ethanol.</p>\r\n<p>But what about the pollution? Well, I&#8217;m not sure about the pollution. I haven&#8217;t seen any actual numbers on that, so all I have to go on is what other people say they heard somewhere. Some people say ethanol is better than non-ethanol gas for the environment overall (notably a former client of my employer says this quite often), while others say it&#8217;s worse. If anyone has any numbers on this, I&#8217;d be interested to see them. But lacking any testable numbers, it seems to me everyone is just arguing whatever reinforces their own beliefs.</p>\r\n<p>And yes, I&#8217;m aware that dark forces (e.g. Archer Daniels Midland Company) are at work making corn an artificially prominent part of the American (and increasingly world) economy in everything from ethanol to high fructose corn syrup to construction materials. And maybe when I&#8217;ve finished reading <cite>Omnivore&#8217;s Dilemma</cite> this will be enough to convince me to act against my own immediate economic interests. But for now, I&#8217;m sticking with the six cents cheaper at the pump and the half a mile-per-dollar more on the road I get with ethanol. As the standard disclaimer says, your mileage may vary, and I&#8217;d encourage everyone to do their own testing in their own cars.</p>','2006-12-10 09:30:05'),(931,'Some Archery History','<p>From <a href=\"http://www.hickoksports.com/history/archery.shtml\">Hickok Sports</a>, a history of archery:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>The modern sport of target archery originated in England during the 14th century, when the longbow became the English army\'s most important weapon, first at the Battle of Crecy (1346) and later at Poitiers and Agincourt. From 1330 to 1414, English kings banned all other sports because they diverted time from archery and a royal decree of 1363 required all Englishmen to practice archery on Sundays and holidays.</p>\r\n<p>[...]</p>\r\n<p>Roving, the predecessor of modern field archery, grew out of casual hunting with bow and arrow. Archers are presented with targets of various shapes and sizes, simulating small animals, and they shoot at unknown ranges over rough ground, not a prepared course.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>Such \"roving\" sounds a lot like modern golf. What lead me to read about ancient archery was this little detail: at the end of a \"roving\" archery match, the archers would shoot an arrow back toward the location at which they began the course. This would be analogous to hitting a golf ball from the 18th hole back to the 1st tee. Depending on the geography of the course, this could be quite a distance, so often the shot was fired up rather high. It wasn\'t really part of the competition &#8212; just a traditional conclusion.</p>\r\n<p>The upshot of this history lesson is that the concluding upwards shot became known as the \"upshot,\" first in archery, and then as a common metaphor, as it is still used today.</p>','2006-12-17 11:21:28'),(932,'Movies, Scrabble, Cities, and Gerald Ford','<p>Last month I assembled all of my earthly possessions in Des Moines, <abbr title=\"Iowa\">IA</abbr>, gave some of them away, put most of them in a truck, and left a few in kitchen cabinets as an accidental gift for my former landlord.

One of those friends works for <abbr title=\"National Broadcasting Company\">NBC</abbr> news, and informed us of Gerald Ford&#8217;s death hours before you knew about it. I forgot about it almost immediately, only to be reminded of it hours after you knew about it. I remember reading something about how there&#8217;s no point in watching the news because you&#8217;ll be told about anything newsworthy anyway whether or not you&#8217;re interested. I think that&#8217;s mostly true.</p>\r\n<p>From Bloomington we went to Peoria to spend &#8220;fake Christmas&#8221; (as only I call it) with some of my family. We talked briefly about Gerald Ford dying and played some Scrabble. We also watched <cite>Charlotte&#8217;s Web</cite>, which was pretty good for a children&#8217;s movie. No wait &#8212; we went to Peoria first between Christmas and &#8220;fake New Year&#8217;s Eve,&#8221; then back to Bloomington, then back to Peoria. On the first trip to Peoria, my friend JJ gave me some music by his friend Mitch Ure after we shot BB guns at empty cans.</p>\r\n<p>After the second trip to Peoria, we went back to Bloomington again, where I saw some of <cite>Cars</cite> while falling asleep.

In Reno, I watched both <cite>Children of Men</cite> and <cite>28 Days Later</cite>, both violent distopian stories set in a future Britian. I preferred <cite>28 Days Later</cite>, not least because it involved zombies. We stayed with my brother and sister-in-law, who played a lot of Scrabble with us, took us to visit my cousin in Sacremento, <abbr title=\"California\">CA</abbr>, took us skiing in Tahoe, and discussed Gerald Ford with us.</p>\r\n<p>I spent a lot of time in Casinos and eventually succumbed to gambling $1 in a penny slot machine while we waited to be seated for breakfast. At one point I was up to $1.07, but I lost it all in the end. Then we flew back to St. Louis, and attempted to drive back to Murphysboro. Unfortunately, all access to Interstate 55 was closed, so we had to take what ended up to be about a two hour detour through St. Louis to find another bridge over the river.

The minister went on to talk at length about <a href=\"http://www.vernonjohns.org/\">Vernon Johns</a> and <a href=\"http://www.rustin.org/\">Bayard Rustin</a>, who both did extensive work for civil rights before King ever arrived in Alabama.</p>\r\n<p>Clearly King&#8217;s speech wasn&#8217;t the beginning of the civil rights movement for these two men, nor for Rosa Parks, who sparked the bus boycott that first made King famous. It was, however, the beginning for the woman who called it &#8220;the beginning.&#8221; Or more precisely, it was the beginning of <em>her</em> civil rights movement &#8212; the moment at which her ideas about civil rights began to move.</p>\r\n<p>And that&#8217;s all movements are really. Before reading bell hooks, I had imagined movements as groups of people physically moving. But while marching is powerful iconography for movements, it is not really the point. The important thing to move is not people&#8217;s bodies, but their ideas. And it&#8217;s clear this doesn&#8217;t happen in some collective reconsideration deserving a title like &#8220;the movement.&#8221; It&#8217;s a more liquid process that can&#8217;t really be quantified. Just as a collection of &#8220;water&#8221; is still &#8220;water,&#8221; the collection of each individual&#8217;s movement on any given issue is just &#8220;movement.&#8221;</p>\r\n<p>Where this becomes important is not so much in determing the beginning of movements, but in determining the end. &#8220;<em>The</em> civil rights movement&#8221; is clearly over, as most of the people involved are either dead or retired. But &#8220;civil rights movement&#8221; goes on, as people&#8217;s ideas about civil rights continue to move.</p>\r\n<p>This movement is a rather abstract concept, not something we can easily quantify (though perhaps votes for Obama for president will come close), but one way to keep people thinking about movement as an ongoing process is to leave off &#8220;the.&#8221; It&#8217;s a rare opportunity to improve public consciousness by doing <em>less</em>. So next time you find yourself talking about a movement, try saying one fewer word. It may just move the way someone thinks.</p>','2007-01-14 13:54:50'),(934,'Decimalisation','<p>In 1866, the US government made it legal to employ weights and measurements of the metric system (e.g. kilometers, liters, grams) in addition to standard US measurements (e.g. miles, gallons, pounds). A hundred years later, the system wasn&#8217;t really catching on in America as quickly as it had throughout most of the world, so in 1975, the US government adopted the metric system for all government weights and measures. Ten years later, the metric system became the preferred system for trade and commerce. After another decade had passed, the metric system became not just preferred, but mandatory on all consumer commodities, though US standard measurements were, and are, still allowed.</p>\r\n<p>Another decade has passed since, but the metric system still hasn&#8217;t really caught on in America. If you look closely at nutritional labels, you can see how many grams of fat your food contains, and you can even see how many liters are in your gallon of milk. But you&#8217;re unlikely to get a ticket for driving too many kilometers per hour. And you certainly won&#8217;t get a ticket for driving too many kilometers per kilosecond. (The decimalisation of time hasn&#8217;t really begun to catch on anywhere outside of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatch_Internet_Time\">Swatch</a>.)</p>\r\n<p>But as with universal health care, America is far behind the curve on the decimalization of weights and measurements. Liberia and Myanmar are the only other two countries in the world not using the metric system for nearly everything. And those two have just been distracted from the task of metrication, both going through civil wars while the rest of the world was converting speeding tickets to be easily divisible by ten.</p>\r\n<p>America, on the other hand, has had plenty of time to do the metrication, but has steadfastly resisted the idea. The state of Kentucky even went so far as to reverse the national government&#8217;s mandate to use the metric system within government agencies. The process of converting the nation to the metric system has generally stalled in the past ten years and shows no signs of restarting any time soon.</p>\r\n<p>While decimalisation has <em>almost</em> spanned the globe in weights and measurements, and hasn&#8217;t really begun in time, decimalisation has actually been completed in every country of the world in one area: currency. Decimalised currency is so ubiquitous that it&#8217;s hard to imagine that there was ever a country that had non-decimal currency.</p>\r\n<p>But prior to 1710, no currency was decimalised. In that year, Russia was the first country to decimalise currency. Peter (\"the Great\") I is most well-known for the westernization of Russia, including oddities such as changing from the Russian calendar to the Julian calendar just as Europe was changing from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar, and <a href=\"http://www.anecdotage.com/index.php?aid=12420\">taxing men who wore beards</a>. And at the time, currency decimalisation probably seemed odd as well.</p>\r\n<p>I didn&#8217;t find any record of the relative value between rubels and kopeks prior to 1710, but assuming it was something other than 100, Peter&#8217;s declaration that it was to be 100 henceforth probably sounded as crazy as someone declaring that a gallon of milk will always cost $5. After all, money back then had actual value based in scarcity, not just the agreed upon value money has today.</p>\r\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t until eighty years later that America, under the progressive leadership of Thomas Jefferson (who would have carried out full metrication at the time were it up to him) became the second country with decimalised currency. The Coinage Act of 1792 defined the dollar as being worth the still-standard 10 dimes and 100 cents, but it also defined an \"eagle\" as being worth 10 dollars, in the form of a gold coin that was minted until 1933. The Coinage Act also took the seemingly ridiculous step of declaring the relative value between gold and silver, with gold worth fifteen times the equivalent weight in silver. Currently, gold is worth about sixty times silver, so that obviously didn&#8217;t stick.</p>\r\n<p>Currency decimalisation did stick, however, and has since been adopted by every country in the world. There are two countries that still formally have non-decimal currency, but not in practice. In Mauritania, one ouguiya has the same value as five khoums, but that value is so low that no one uses khoums at all. The same is true of Madagascar&#8217;s currency, where one ariary has the value of five iraimbilanjas.</p>\r\n<p>Neither of these currencies would be difficult to use today if they were in circulation (except perhaps pronouncing \"iraimbilanja\"). Because ten is easily divisible by five, we can use decimal math to make calculations on these currencies. If I had thirteen khoums, and I wanted to deposit them in a bank that recorded money in ouguiya, they could divide thirteen by five and record that I had deposited 2.6 ouguiyas. Similarly, it&#8217;s easy for us to exchange any number of quarters for the equivalent amount of dollars. When doing the math, we don&#8217;t actually consider four quarters to a dollar; we consider one quarter to 0.25 dollars.</p>\r\n<p>Where non-decimal currency becomes a problem is with relative values that don&#8217;t work cleanly in decimal math. For example, one thaler in Hamburg was once worth three marks. If I took four marks into a Hamburg bank that recorded money in thalers, they would need to record that I deposited 1.333333333... thalers, with the three extending forever. Non-decimal currency works fine under a similarly non-decimal number system. But the prevalence of decimal math in the world has encouraged a gradual decimalisation of the world.</p>\r\n<p>This raises the question of when and how decimal math conquered all other number systems throughout the world. The common assumption is that ten-digit math came from ten-digit appendages, i.e. the ten fingers on our hands. But this certainly wasn&#8217;t the only option. Several languages still indicate base numbers of twenty, a vigesimal number system, presumably based on the number of fingers plus toes. The Danish word for sixty, for example, is literally \"three times twenty,\" though it is now written in the conventional \"60\" or \"six times ten.\"</p>\r\n<p>The twelve months on our calendars, twelve hours on our clocks, and twelve inches to a foot all suggest a duodecimal (base twelve) number system, possibly derived from the twelve knuckles on the fingers of one hand (not counting the thumb). Duodecimal math is actually simpler than decimal math because twelve has more factors than ten. Those four marks I took to the hypothetical Hamburg bank, for example, could be easily recorded as 1.4 thalers in duodecimal notation.</p>\r\n<p>In 1935, F. Emerson Andrews wrote a book titled <cite>New Numbers: How Acceptance of a Duodecimal Base Would Simplify Mathematics</cite>. And if you&#8217;re interested, there are still people promoting duodecimal numbers today. <a href=\"http://www.dozenal.org/index.php?u=34\">The Dozenal Society of America is next meeting</a> on October 6, 2007 at 10am, location to be announced. But as they declare <q>Today is day 24; of month 1; of year 11#3</q>, I would double-check that date and time (and, of course, get a location) before you head to the meeting.</p>\r\n<p>Dozenal societies and Kentucky notwithstanding, the decimalisation of all things numeric appears to be slowly crawling forward. It will be interesting to see which American politician will next join the ranks of Peter the Great and Thomas Jefferson, declaring America decimalised, and if we&#8217;ll be doing so before or after Liberia takes the plunge.</p>','2007-01-28 18:00:43'),(935,'Time is Elastic','<p>One of my university professors told me a secret about how he would decide how much homework to give his students. The secret was: it doesn&#8217;t matter. Students will complain that any amount of homework is too much, and then they&#8217;ll find time to do it. A student with only one class and very little homework will somehow fill her schedule such that the very little homework seems to be taking too much time, but is still possible to complete. And a student with five classes all with extensive homework will somehow clear her schedule such that the homework seems to be taking too much time, but is still possible to complete. Time is magically elastic for university students.</p>\r\n<p>When I worked in an office, I would go to work in the morning, then back home for lunch, then back to work in the afternoon, then back home at night. During those trips, I occasionally imagined how much more time I would have to do things I should be doing more often (e.g cooking, reading, exercising). Four trips a day at ten minutes per trip, plus time packing up and unpacking on each end, must be at least an hour of every day I spent in transition.</p>\r\n<p>Now that I&#8217;ve been working from home for a while, I have almost no time lost in transition. Yet I notice the extra time hasn&#8217;t materialized. I can now work <em>in the kitchen</em>, and somehow I still feel like I don&#8217;t have time to cook a good meal for lunch. My time appears to be just as elastic as it was when I was a university student.</p>\r\n<p>Where does time go when it stretches? For a full time student, I think the time goes primarily to socializing. When your friend invites you to go somewhere and you don&#8217;t have pressing homework, it would seem rather unlike a student to decline the invitation. And a university is full of friends inviting each other to go places. Socializing is a black hole, endlessly sucking in all student time not otherwise attracted to a mass of homework.</p>\r\n<p>For me, the black hole is web work. I try to restrict myself to close to forty hours a week for my full time employer, and though I almost never reach that goal, that&#8217;s not really the problem. My time sink is largely freelance work. When someone offers me money to work on an interesting project, it just seems odd to decline. What would I even say? &#8220;No thanks. That sounds interesting, and I like money, but I&#8217;d rather read books and cook better meals.&#8220; Maybe I should say that, but I don&#8217;t.</p>\r\n<p>Your black hole is what you won&#8217;t regret. When your university friends come back from the bar, and you&#8217;ve just spent a few hours making sure you understand the subject <em>really</em> well instead of just <em>okay</em>, you&#8217;re going to regret the missed opportunities at the bar. But they won&#8217;t regret the missed studying. And when that really neat website launches after I turned down the opportunity to work on it so that I could <a href=\"http://chezpim.typepad.com/blogs/2007/01/pad_thai_for_be.html\">learn to make Pad Thai</a> instead of Mac and Cheese, I&#8217;ll be regretting the missed opportunity on the web, but I don&#8217;t yet regret the Mac and Cheese.</p>\r\n<p>So it turns out time is elastic for everyone, not just students. And we all just choose a different black hole to suck it up. Some day I hope to be the kind of person whose black hole is the simpler things in life: good food, good books, health, a sunny day. But right now my black hole is interesting web work. I don&#8217;t need more time, and most likely you don&#8217;t either. What&#8217;s your black hole, sucking up all your free time? TV? Books?

I left a note at the local Co-op grocery store expressing interest in volunteering, but no one ever called me. I sent an email to the <a href=\"http://bigmuddyimc.org/\">Big Muddy Independent Media Center</a> volunteering my web development skills to improve their website, but no one responded. I posted on <a href=\"http://carbondale.craigslist.org/\">the local Craig&#8217;s List</a> about starting a band, but no one responded. One might conclude that this town doesn&#8217;t like me, but I suspect it just has different means of communication.</p>\r\n<p>Southern Illinois isn&#8217;t big on web-based communication, and I can&#8217;t often bring myself to drive the twenty minutes into town, from our place out in Murphysboro, for what often seems like a waste of time and gas. So I stay at home a lot, which I think is a bad thing. We&#8217;ve been looking at moving, but our lease here goes through August, so we&#8217;ll need to find a pretty nice place to make it worth moving before then. Meanwhile, I&#8217;m writing a lot more email and talking on the phone a lot more than I ever have before. But that&#8217;s not really making me any friends.</p>\r\n<p>There are a few people in the area who actively communicate via the internet. There&#8217;s a group of bloggers at <a href=\"http://landolinkin.us/carbondale/bytelife/\">Carbondale Bytelife</a> who seem to share my inclination towards online communication. They were searching for additional contributors when I first moved to the area, and I tried volunteering for that too, but the email bounced and I didn&#8217;t follow up, so no friends there yet.</p>\r\n<p>But I believe I am making some enemies there, so I guess that&#8217;s a start. Part of the reason I didn&#8217;t follow up on my bounced email was that Carbondale Bytelife is full of discussion of Carbondale, and being new to the area, I don&#8217;t really know much about Cardbondale, so I have few opportunities to jump in. I do know a bit about electoral politics though, having participated in a few campaigns, served as electoral judge, and managed a voter registration drive. So the Carbondale mayoral election seemed like a good place to add my voice to the mix.</p>\r\n<p>There&#8217;s an old saying about the three things you should never talk about in polite conversation: sex, religion, and politics. I regularly discuss all three, so I guess I&#8217;m a slow learner. Or maybe just impolite. I believe my first comment to a Carbondale blog was to question why Bob Pauls listed the age of each mayoral candidate in <a href=\"http://www.landolinkin.us/carbondale/bytelife/2007/01/carbondale-candidates-online-not.html\">a post about candidate websites</a>. It struck me as a way to caricature candidates and vote on those caricatures rather than actual issues (e.g. Obama is \"the black candidate,\" nevermind what his positions are). But apparenly Bob is just concerned about the \"digital divide\" and thinks age is a big part of it. I&#8217;m not so sure age is a big part of it, but I thought better of pursuing the issue and establishing myself through disagreement.</p>\r\n<p>But I guess my better judgement lapsed when I read <a href=\"http://www.shawneenet.net/dispatch/2007/03/coles-rope-dope.html\">a post by someone I only know as \"dave\" on the mayoral primary</a>, which seemed to be subtly skewed in favor of the incumbent, Mayor Cole. Truth be told, I didn&#8217;t realize as I was pointing out the bias I saw that I was commenting on dave&#8217;s personal blog and not Carbondale Bytelife, which I believe was formerly known by the name of dave&#8217;s blog Carbondaley Dispatch. But that probably wouldn&#8217;t have changed what I wrote much. I don&#8217;t know much about the candidates, but I&#8217;ve had an anti-incumbent bias every since I learned that incumbent candidates have a ridiculously high re-election rate. That just can&#8217;t be healthy for democracy.</p>\r\n<p>So I&#8217;d been reading a lot of pro-Cole discussion in the local blogs, and had the general impression that he was a widely liked Mayor and would probably win by a landslide. But then he lost in the primary (came in second to the only other candidate who will be in the final election), and that made me wonder if the people I&#8217;d been reading weren&#8217;t confusing their hopes for reality. So with that suspicion, I read dave&#8217;s post, which makes an analogy between Cole losing the primary and a famous boxing match between Ali and Foreman. I don&#8217;t know a lot about boxing, but I know Ali won that fight, and Cole was analogous to Ali in the post, so it immediately struck me as a sort of cheerleading for Cole.</p>\r\n<p>So I said as much. I suggested dave was letting his own bias slip into his writing in subtle ways throughout the post, and he should state his bias upfront so readers could interpret his words with a grain of salt. At this point, I had no reason to think dave was anything other than a voter who somewhat favored Cole, but was trying not to show bias. I know there&#8217;s a widespread myth that people shouldn&#8217;t have bias, and I think that&#8217;s harmful to public discussion, so in my comment suggesting dave should be more open about his bias, I said <q>It\'s okay to have a political bias,</q> in the hopes that he wouldn&#8217;t feel the need to act unbiased.</p>\r\n<p>I think everyone is biased, and pretending otherwise is just silly. Later in the comments, someone wrote <q>I believe you should tell them you\'re on Brad\'s payroll, Dave.</q> I first thought this was sarcasm, suggesting that my perceptions of bias were inaccurate, that I was seeing bias where none existed. But then dave wrote <q>How many times must I say that I maintain Cole\'s web site?</q> That&#8217;s when I realized that the earlier comment was not actually sarcastic. This really changed the whole discussion. So dave&#8217;s writing about a mayoral election, and he maintains the website for one of the candidates. I tried to move past my initial reaction of \"are you serious?\" and actually answer dave&#8217;s question, saying <q>I think it\'s standard practice for writers to include such a disclaimer every single time a conflict of interest comes up.</q></p>\r\n<p>I do this myself, as you may have noticed. When <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2006/12/10/Ethanol_Efficiency/\">I wrote about ethanol</a>, for example, I mentioned in the second sentence that my employer has clients in the ethanol industry. I&#8217;ve had very little interaction with those clients, and the largest of them had just recently cancelled their contract with my employer somewhat abruptly, so I could make a reasonable case that this doesn&#8217;t bias my opinion of ethanol at all. But that would be ridiculous. Everything biases my opinions. Everything I read, everyone I work for, even everything I eat. I likely have a bias towards brown things because I like chocolate. I don&#8217;t really recognize this bias, but it makes sense that I would have it, because <em>everyone is biased</em>. Everyone.</p>\r\n<p>Everyone except dave apparently, who wrote a new post today titled <a href=\"http://www.shawneenet.net/dispatch/2007/03/biased-my-sterisk.html\">Biased my *sterisk</a>, explaining his belief that he is not biased regarding the mayoral election, despite being employed by one of the candidates. He wrote: <q>So what am I supposed to do? Quit? Not comment on the race?</q></p>\r\n<p>To answer the rhetorical question: no, dave is not supposed to do any of those things. That would be ridiculous. Because bias is so pervasive, we shouldn&#8217;t let it disrupt our ability to discuss interesting topics. And we don&#8217;t need to go out of our way to try to compensate for it, as dave did by listing a bunch of things he doesn&#8217;t like about his employer, Cole. All we need to do is simply state obvious conflicts of interest when they come up. I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a huge burden, and it makes it easier for everyone to understand our perspective.</p>\r\n<p>One might argue that our employers are not actually our primary conflicts of interest, that focusing on them creates a distorted image of our perspective. And I think that would be an interesting argument. But dave doesn&#8217;t appear to be saying that. He&#8217;s just claiming he has no bias, which I maintain is just silly. Because everyone is biased.</p>','2007-03-07 10:49:29'),(939,'Six Degrees of Geek','<p>We start with Cory Doctorow.

I&#8217;m currently in Des Moines, attending interviews of some would-be new web developers at my company, which is putting me up in a hotel for a few days. It&#8217;s an odd experience, both because I&#8217;m living like a tourist in a city that still feels like home, and also because I&#8217;m living like a businessperson, which I don&#8217;t feel like at all.</p>\r\n<p>For example, this afternoon I was sitting in the hotel room, which my company paid for, eating leftovers from last night&#8217;s dinner, which my company will also pay for. I feel like I should instead be going out for lunch, since my company is paying for meals anyway, maybe take out some other businessperson and explain to them the synergy of our new product or something. But I was happy eating my cold Pad Thai and watching the end of a show on the History channel about Machu Picchu.</p>\r\n<p>In that show I learned something that you might have learned if you followed the previous link to Wikipedia&#8217;s article on Machu Picchu: that Peru is suing Yale University over some bones taken from Machu Picchu by Hiram Bingham. In 1911, Bingham rediscovered the Incan city of Macchu Picchu, which had been abandoned since the 1500s, when the Spanish conquered the Incan empire, after first dividing it. The Incan government did not have clear lines of succession, and the Spanish took advantage of this by promoting a competition of authority within the government, which ended up destroying the empire. History repeats itself.</p>\r\n<p>So then everyone left Machu Picchu, and it was empty when Hiram Bingham started digging up bones. He brought the bones back to Yale, where they remain today. Then he went on to become Governor of Connecticut, then US Senator. Interesting footnote: he was only governor for one day before he became Senator. In 1929, Bingham was censured by the Senate on corruption charges involving lobbyists. History repeats itself.</p>\r\n<p>Hiram Bingham was a Republican, and was pushed from office in 1932 when Democrats won in a nationwide landslide following the Great Depression. Bingham&#8217;s father and namesake was a missionary to Hawaii, as was his grandfather. Interesting footnote: his grandfather was also pastor of an African American church in Connecticut. One of his sons was a Democratic congressman, while his namesake son helped Jews escape the Holocaust in France to the US, despite official US policies intended to limit such immigration. US Secretary of State Colin Powell later praised Hiram Bingham, the 4th, for his &#8220;constructive dissent.&#8221; History repeats itself.</p>\r\n<p>Getting back to Machu Picchu, I found one line from <a href=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4770002.stm\">the BBC&#8217;s report on the lawsuit from Peru</a> particularly interesting: <q>But Yale says it followed standard collecting practices at the time, and that it has made a reasonable offer to return some of the artefacts.</q> That phrase, a reasonable offer, was recently used by the White House to explain why members of the American government will not be testifying under oath about their actions. History repeats itself.</p>\r\n<p>President Bush, you may recall, is a graduate of Yale, so perhaps that&#8217;s where he developed the impression that an offer in clear violation of established rules is \"a reasonable offer.\" Unlike the Incans, there is little ambiguity about authorites in the American government. And there is apparently little ambiguity over who owns the Machu Picchu bones at Yale. Hiram Bingham the third, the one who took the bones, wrote <q>Now they [the bones] do not belong to us, but to the Peruvian government, who allowed us to take them out of the country on condition that they be returned in eighteen months.</q> That was ninety five years ago.</p>\r\n<p>I suspect riding up the Hiram Bingham Highway to Machu Picchu will be just as odd an experience as this week in Des Moines, or most of my travels for that matter. Another place I don&#8217;t really belong, playing another role I don&#8217;t really understand. I guess that&#8217;s what makes this life interesting.</p>','2007-03-24 13:47:54'),(941,'A Mysterious Dinner','<p>At dinner tonight, I thought my waitress was hitting on me. Or maybe not hitting on me, but trying to get me to hit on her. She was about my age, and nicer than one would normally be to a stranger, but of course that&#8217;s just part of the job. What gave me the impression she was hitting on me were the long pauses she left after everything I said.</p>\r\n<p>She would say &#8220;Are you ready to order?&#8221; And I would reply &#8220;Yes, I&#8217;ll have the Tortelini Portabella.&#8221; This is how normal waitress-diner exchanges go in my experience. But then she would just stand there and look at me. What was she waiting for? It was like a scene in a romantic comedy, where one person is afraid to say anything about the obvious chemistry, and instead just waits for the other to bring it up.</p>\r\n<p>Except there was no chemistry. Not on my end, anyway. Not only am I married, but even if I weren&#8217;t, she was more creeping me out than attracting me. I was eating at the restaurant attached to the hotel I&#8217;m staying in, and charging my meal to my room. So I had given her my room number. In one of those romantic comedies, she would maybe show up at my door later. But in a horror movie, I would wake up in the bathtub missing a kidney. And I was seeing myself more in the horror movie plot. Even if she wasn&#8217;t a serial organ-thief (and really, it would be kind of dumb doing that so close to where she works), did she make a habit of picking up guests in the adjacent hotel? Guests wearing wedding rings? Isn&#8217;t that a little odd?</p>\r\n<p>Yes, it is, I concluded. I tried to watch as she spoke to other tables. Did she do the same thing with them? The nearest occupied table was too far away to tell. I looked at her co-workers as they walked by. Did any of their faces reveal a secret fear that my waitress was a nutjob? They offered no clues.</p>\r\n<p>But then, toward the end of my meal, my waitress herself revealed the truth. If I weren&#8217;t already suspicious, I may not have even noticed. &#8220;Is everything alright?&#8220; she asked. &#8220;Yes, thanks,&#8221; I said. Normally I would expect a waitress to leave my table at this point, but by then I expected this waitress to awkwardly stand there for a moment in silence. She did neither. Instead she did something I didn&#8217;t expect at all. She said &#8220;Are you done with your sal- <b>*hiccup*</b> salad?&#8221; I answered &#8220;Yes, thanks,&#8221; as I had long ago finished my salad.</p>\r\n<p>Now I&#8217;m a little disappointed. My dinner was neither the would-be romantic comedy nor the horror movie I had imagined. It was just a waitress with the hiccups, trying not to hiccup in the middle of talking to me. That&#8217;s not very interesting at all. But still, I locked the door.</p>','2007-03-26 18:27:02'),(942,'Better Media Diets','<p>Recently I&#8217;ve read two apparently independent analogies between bite-size internet media and junk food. The first was Aaron Swartz, who founded and sold <a href=\"http://reddit.com/\">Reddit</a>, a website offering bite-size internet media, for millions. <a href=\"http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/everythinggood\">Aaron self-critically wrote</a>:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>The same goes for reading stories on Reddit or your friends\' pointless twits about their life. Looking at photos of sunsets or reading one-liners takes no cognitive effort. It\'s the mental equivalent of snack food. You start eating one and before you know it you\'ve gone through two cans of Pringles and become a world expert on Evan Williams\' travel habits.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>The second analogist was Dave Rogers, who ironically likes to post photos of sunsets between repetitions of a one-liner <q>Technology changes <i>how</i> we do things, it does not change <i>what</i> we do.</q> <a href=\"http://homepage.mac.com/dave_rogers/GHD03-07.html#note_3188\">Dave wrote</a>:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>But these online interactions are mostly shallow, almost two-dimensional projections of real interactions. That third, \"physical\" dimension includes some important features that we\'ve evolved to help us get along with one another. But since the two-dimensional interactions can provide most of the same rewards, (With greater immediacy and convenience! Just like \"fast food.\") as \"real\" interactions, we invest too much time in this simulated reality of the network, consuming far too many \"empty calories,\" and growing socially \"flabby\" and unhealthy.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>As it happens, between my steady diet of junk-food short articles such as Aaron&#8217;s and Dave&#8217;s, I&#8217;m slowly (four months!) reading a book about the actual food half of this analogy, <cite>The Omnivore&#8217;s Dilemna</cite>. So I like this analogy, probably because it&#8217;s convenient for me. But I don&#8217;t care much for the conclusions Aaron and Dave draw from the analogy.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, Dave suggests we should all go outside more, and Aaron suggests we should read more books. These are both good things to do, but I don&#8217;t think the suggestions really help much more than saying &#8220;go vegetarian&#8221; helps improve our standard diet. All of these suggestions presume a consciousness to our decision-making that doesn&#8217;t often exist. One might argue that we need to live more consciously, and I wouldn&#8217;t disagree, but I still don&#8217;t think that would be especially helpful advice for a world awash in junk food.</p>\r\n<p>Recognizing that most of our decisions are made out of habit, and also that it&#8217;s very difficult to change our habits in ways that conflict with the norms of society, I think a better solution is to change the norms of society such that our habits lead to better results. This is the solution I see working to solve the actual junk food problem.</p>\r\n<p>Following this analogy, let&#8217;s assume we eat too much meat (we do) and we want to convince everyone to eat less meat. One strategy, notably that of PETA, is to change the way we all think about meat. Meat is murder, PETA says. This doesn&#8217;t really work, though, because we can consciously recognize that yes, animals probably suffer to some extent in the production of a hamburger, while still craving that hamburger. This problem with PETA&#8217;s strategy is humorously captured in the following image.</p>\r\n<img src=\"http://typewriting.org/image/article/content/meat_is_murder.jpg\"  alt=\"MEAT IS MURDER. Tasty, tasty murder.\" />\r\n<p class=\"caption\">Photo source unknown</p>\r\n<p>The other, I think better, solution is veggie burgers. Veggie burgers work because they allow us to eat more healthy food without fundamentally changing the way we think about eating. I know this works because it&#8217;s becoming increasingly difficult to eat a vegetarian diet, as modern vegetarian food is almost indiscernable from actual meat. But the result is the same whether or not we are conscious of the change: lower meat consumption is a healthier diet.</p>\r\n<p>Taking this back to the metaphorical junk food of a web-based snack-size media diet, I think we can best increase the depth of our media consumption subtly. If we can make ideas of more depth look and feel like the quicker stream of information to which we&#8217;ve become accustomed, we can benefit without needing to fundamentally alter our habits. Newspapers, for example, do this by breaking up a longer article into multiple pages. By the time you get to the bottom of a four paragraph article and realize it&#8217;s actually longer than four paragraphs, you&#8217;ve invested enough in the article that you continue to the next page. And the longer you read, the more you&#8217;re willing to continue. This way, a twelve page article can slowly suck in a reader who would avoid the same article simply out of habit if the length were immediately obvious.</p>\r\n<p>So I agree with Aarom and Dave that we eat junk food and consume a media diet analogous to junk food because it&#8217;s easy. And we could fight against doing what&#8217;s easy, but we could also make it easier to do better. I think it&#8217;s tempting for those who are doing better to expect everyone else to follow suit. I think eating less meat is better, for example, but it wasn&#8217;t long after becoming vegetarian that I stopped expecting everyone else to eat less meat because it&#8217;s the right thing to do. I now expect everyone else to eat less meat because I&#8217;m making it easier.</p>\r\n<p>I recognize the irony in suggesting that the best way to make people more thoughtful is to decrease the thought required to change. And I&#8217;m also not sure what the media equivalent of veggie burgers is. But I thought it worth mentioning nonetheless.</p>','2007-04-09 08:58:20'),(943,'Playing Here','<p><a href=\"http://playinghere.com/\">Playing Here</a> is a website I&#8217;ve been working on in my spare time for a few months now.

I&#8217;ve written in the past about the unfortunate <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2005/04/11/Apple:_Think_Same/#content\">lack</a> <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2007/03/09/Six_Degrees_of_Geek/#content\">of</a> <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2005/05/12/Diversity%3A_Even_Better_than_Beards/#content\">diversity</a> in my industry, so it&#8217;s a little embarrassing to admit that not only were both candidates white, male, and relatively the same age, they also had the same name, Dan. Oh, and they\'re both from the same city too. I don&#8217;t think we could have found more superficially similar candidates if we&#8217;d tried. I wasn&#8217;t really involved in the early hiring process, so I&#8217;m not sure if anything could have been done to cast a wider net in the search. Maybe there are just a lot of similar people looking for web developer jobs in central Iowa. Nonetheless, the irony is not lost on me.</p>\r\n<p>But beyond the irony are some, I think, interesting and unique Dans. It&#8217;s true, they both added <a href=\"http://blogadvisorysystem.com/\">The Airbag Blog Advisory System</a> to their blogs yesterday, but they did get different advisories. Interview number one was <a href=\"http://danmarvelo.us/\">Dan Conner</a>, whose <a href=\"http://danmarvelo.us/older/2007/4/11/im-sure-the-unicorns-will/\">advisory is currently \"elevated\"</a>, and who just this morning <a href=\"http://danmarvelo.us/older/2007/4/12/link-href-right-here-media-interview-rel-mine/\">wrote about his interview process</a>:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p><strong>Ian and Scott remain in the conference room atop the <a href=\"http://www.flickr.com/photos/pil/167987208/\">Butler Mansion</a></strong>, watch on another MacBook connected via Remote Desktop (or whatever that is on a Mac) to the one I have, and break out some microwave popcorn for the show. it feels awkward at first. I giggle a bit with an uncomfortable but accepting feeling, and the awkwardness starts to recede.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>For the record, I recall no microwave popcorn. But it was awkward (maybe popcorn would have helped), and I&#8217;m glad Dan was able to get past that and have some fun. Unfortunately he wasn&#8217;t able to accept the job offer, so I won&#8217;t be working with him. The second interview was <a href=\"http://www.hellerich.net/\">Dan Hellerich</a>, whose <a href=\"http://www.hellerich.net/posts/55\">advisory is currently \"asshat\"</a> (though I don&#8217;t see any rough language at all), and who <a href=\"http://www.hellerich.net/posts/54\">posted yesterday about his move</a>. His technical interview was equally awkward, but hopefully it was also somewhat fun. He accepted the job in any case, so I&#8217;ll be in Des Moines for the next month helping him become familiar with our projects before my <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2007/03/24/The_Highway_to_Machu_Picchu/#content\">trip to Peru</a>.</p>\r\n<p>I hope we can reduce the awkwardness factor in future interviews without reducing the fun. But overall, the interviews turned out well. We only ended up with one of the Dans we wanted, but that may turn out to be for the best. At least now we don&#8217;t need to come up with nicknames to differentiate. There&#8217;s still another opening for a web developer at my employer, if you know anyone who might be interested.

INVALID LOYALTY.</p>\r\n<p>Thankfully we&#8217;re not there quite yet. I was using a gas station affiliated with the local grocery store, and apaprently I pressed the wrong button to indicate I wanted to use my discount card to get a discount on gas (in exchange, apparently, for my loyalty). So when prompted to scan my card, I scanned my credit card. And the result was this, I think, funny error message: INVALID LOYALTY.</p>\r\n<p>I was in a bit of a hurry on my way out of town, but I thought it was worth repeating the process to get a picture of the gas machine apparently questioning my patriotism.</p>','2007-04-18 09:09:20'),(946,'Moving to Denver','<p>I&#8217;m a little late in mentioning here that Jessica and I are moving to Denver after we return from <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2007/03/24/The_Highway_to_Machu_Picchu/#content\">Peru</a>. The possibility first came up a few months ago, but we just signed a lease this weekend, so it&#8217;s fairly certain now. I also signed a contract this weekend, to become a web developer at <a href=\"http://integer.com/\">the Integer Group</a>. Astute readers will notice I am already a web developer at the Integer Group. I&#8217;m just moving from the Des Moines branch to the Denver branch.</p>\r\n<p>I&#8217;m also moving from working remotely back to an actual office. For much of my life, my dream job was to work from home online. When Jessica found work in Illinois after searching for teaching work in Des Moines, I actually had the opportunity to work from home online. I was surprised to discover it wasn&#8217;t all I had hoped. It was certainly a luxury to be able to fold laundry while thinking about issues at work, but it was also somewhat of a burden to be thinking about issues at work while folding laundry.</p>\r\n<p>And living in a small rural town didn&#8217;t help much either. I wasn&#8217;t especially excited about Denver itself until our visit this weekend, but now I am. There&#8217;s a lot more going on near our new place in the middle of Denver than our old place twenty minutes outside of Carbondale. I wasn&#8217;t really happy with working from Carbondale, and Jessica wasn&#8217;t really happy with working from Des Moines, so hopefully we can both be happy working from Denver.</p>\r\n<p>My work transition is actually a bit more than just moving between two branches of the same company; my job will actually be changing slightly. For example, I&#8217;m currently one of three full time web developers in Des Moines, but I will be the only full time developer in Denver. The company is twice as large in Denver, so I&#8217;ll have a bit more responsibility. But I also won&#8217;t be doing any work for client websites as I do now, only making internal tools for the people at Integer.</p>\r\n<p>So I still have two more weeks in Des Moines, helping to train my replacement, <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2007/04/12/Two_Interviews/#content\">Dan</a>. Then we have a week and a half in Peru for vacation (scheduled before Denver came up). Then I head out to Denver, with Jessica to follow shortly after. Hopefully I&#8217;ll be done moving and travelling for a while after that. It&#8217;s exhausting to be in a different city almost every week.

Crazy, huh?</p>','2007-05-29 18:23:23'),(951,'The Omnivore\'s Dilemna','<p>I finally finished <cite>The Omnivore&#8217;s Dilemna</cite> while in Peru. I read the first half in about four months, and the last half in about four days. It&#8217;s a lengthy book, but I found it well worth it. It did, however, ultimately fall a bit short of my expectations. The book is an excellent collection of ideas around a specific philosophy of eating, but it is not, as the title suggests, a general-purpose thesis on eating well.</p>\r\n<p>The book starts with, and claims to be an answer to the question <q>What should we have for dinner?</q> But by the end it becomes clear the entire book is rooted in the unstated assumption that industrialization was a grave mistake. So the book is more specifically an answer to the question <q>What is the best pre-industrial meal available in our post-industrial world?</q> The answer, unsurprisingly, turns out to be pretty much exactly what it would have been before industrialization.</p>\r\n<p>It is this certainty in industrialization as the root cause of most modern dietary problems that makes the book so compelling to continue reading. It wasn&#8217;t until nearly the end that I realized that such obvious food issues as health, economic class, geography, and aesthetics would not be addressed in any more depth than their relation to industrialization. By then I had already invested too much under the assumption other topics would be covered to stop reading. And I wouldn&#8217;t have stopped reading anyway, as Michael Pollan is a captivating story-teller, even when the moral of his story is entirely disagreeable.</p>\r\n<p>It is because the book was written so well that I was so disappointed that the topic turned out to be deceptively narrow in scope. I think this paradox is most clearly demonstrated in the section on vegetarianism, the only in the book that significantly strayed from the central theme of industrialization, presumably because it would be absurd to write a book around thoughtful eating and not cover vegetarianism in much depth. This was the most interesting section for me, not only because I am vegetarian. I have been vegetarian for over ten years and this section presented arguments both for and against vegetarianism that I had never considered.</p>\r\n<p>Which made it all the more disappointing that it ended with a conclusion suggesting that vegetarianism only makes sense as a means of avoiding the industrial food supply. This was where it became clear to me that industrialization was not simply the context in which Pollan chose to consider food, but rather food was the context in which he chose to consider industrialization. One can imagine him pitching his publisher a book on industrialization, and the publisher responding with &#8220;why don&#8217;t you write about food instead?&#8221; The child of those two is <cite>The Omnivore&#8217;s Dilemna</cite>, which while enjoyable, left me wishing to read either of the hypothetical books.</p>\r\n<p>To beat a dead horse (an act Pollan apparently deems palatable so long as it happens outside an industrial economy), I&#8217;d like to note where the anti-industrialization bias creeps outside the context of food. In the section on mushroom hunting, he makes a very convincing argument that mushrooms can&#8217;t be reliably described over email or even over the phone. The argument in favor face-to-face communication is so good that it&#8217;s difficult to see why it should be restricted to mushrooms. Surely I can also understand driving a car infinitely better by talking to someone familiar with it than by reading about it in a driver&#8217;s education manual. After all, if someone doesn&#8217;t really know how to drive a car, he should be as dead as someone who doesn&#8217;t really know how to identify a poisonous mushroom.</p>\r\n<p>So industrialization has diminished food and communication, or so says this book published, distributed, and sold in the industrial economy. And it has also diminished government (the <abbr title=\"United States Department of Agriculture\">USDA</abbr> is subservient to industry), medicine (modern science is so untrustworthy regarding diet that Pollan doesn&#8217;t even bother telling the reader how the health care establishment would answer the question of what we should eat), and, well, everything really. It&#8217;s not even that I find many of these anti-industrialization ideas particularly disagreeable. I personally distrust modern medicine, for example, apparently with <a href=\"http://sciencethatmatters.com/archives/30\">good reason</a>. So I would be very interested to read about an alternative world view. But none is offered here. The book details problems of an industrialized food supply, but no real solutions.</p>\r\n<p>Pollan admits that we live in an industrialized world, so his ideal non-industrialized diet is at best only feasible for a small minority of omnivores. But he stops there. If you&#8217;re in that small minority, <cite>The Omnivore&#8217;s Dilemna</cite> gives you a pretty good idea of what you should have for dinner. If you&#8217;re not, you only get a pretty good idea of what would be good for dinner if you were. The book ends with a chapter titled <q>The Perfect Meal,</q> which (no surprise) is one most removed from industrializations, one hunted and gathered by the eater himself:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>This is not the way I want to eat every day. &#8232; But imagine for a moment if we once again knew, strictly as a matter of course, these few unremarkable things: What it is we&#8217;re eating.

Alexander, is a book I would not recommend. After finishing <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2007/05/30/The_Omnivore\'s_Dilemna/\">The Omnivore&#8217;s Dilemna</a>, I had a few plane trips and a few days of vacation ahead of me, so I picked up another book at an English-language book store in Peru. I didn&#8217;t see anything I really wanted to read. It was mostly a lot of popular fiction, e.g. Stephen King, and I&#8217;m pretty picky about what fiction I want to spend my time reading. Reality is interesting enough.</p>\r\n<p>So I made the mistake of choosing <cite>Intimate Cartographies</cite>, mostly because I vaguely recalled listening to a radio interview with the author. I knew it had something to do with a cartographer who lost a child, but I wrongly remembered that it was nonfiction. The book store had most of the books shrinkwrapped, so I couldn&#8217;t flip through to confirm my memory. It was cheap, so I bought it. And I had nothing else to read, so I read it. And it was tedious.</p>\r\n<p>To be fair, I think it was intentionally tedious. It was tedious because it gave the reader (me) a glimpse into the grieving process of someone who lost a child. And, as we might expect, that process takes a long time and involves a lot of replaying the same events over and over again. So if you want to get a hint of the experience of losing a child, this is probably a good book. But who <em>wants</em> to experience that? Certainly not me.</p>\r\n<p>I&#8217;d like to read about it, but I&#8217;d like to do so from a distance. Such a distance would allow me to enjoy the interesting discussions of maps without dreading the impending return to the lost child story, which isn&#8217;t really much of a story. The child was lost; end of story. Or would that it were anyway. Instead, the book is three hundred pages repeating the same story over and over again in different words. Not enjoyable reading, unless perhaps you&#8217;re one of the unfortunate parents who has actually lost a child. Then you&#8217;d probably appreciate <cite>Intimate Cartographies</cite>.

And though I&#8217;ve only responded to one ad so far, and my band remains entirely hypothetical, I have noticed something interesting.

I&#8217;ll admit, I have. I don&#8217;t remember whether it was before or after I first encountered a <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spork\">spork</a> that the idea to combine a fork and a knife first struck me. But I do know that after that moment, I  looked on simple forks and knives with some disdain. Why was humanity wasting its time with two utensils when it could use just one? Isn&#8217;t the increased efficiency and simplicity of knife-forks obvious to all who eat?</p>\r\n<p>Apparently not obvious enough. Decades later, knife-forks remain relatively rare. The problem with a knife-fork, it seems, is that it can easily cut your mouth. I expect this is why most cultures consider it rude to put a knife in one&#8217;s mouth.</p>\r\n<p>Of course we could all be more conscious of our food as it enters our mouth, and indeed we should be for reasons beyond knife-forks, but we&#8217;re not. We eat with little regard to the food we&#8217;re consuming, much less the utensils we&#8217;re using to transport that food from plate to mouth. However, the mouth-cutting problem is apparently not insurmountable for knife-forks. When <a href=\"http://www.nmm.ac.uk/collections/nelson/viewObject.cfm?ID=REL0115\">Horatio Nelson</a> lost an arm in 1797, for example, paying more attention to avoid cutting his mouth must have seemed a small price to pay to avoid continuously swapping knife for fork, fork for knife, while eating a meal. So he used knife-forks.</p>\r\n<p>Still, most two-armed eaters have proven unwilling to adapt eating behavior to accommodate the superior knife-fork. Alas, another brilliant idea brought down by an unreceptive society. I&#8217;ve since had many more such ideas. Men and women can share unisex bathrooms. Gender inequity: solved! Plumbing waste: solved! Rich people should give money to poor people. Poverty: solved! Abuse of power: solved! Everyone should vote for their favorite candidate. Democracy: solved! And so on.</p>\r\n<p>Yes, I&#8217;ve had many knife-forks, solutions that work great as long as everyone is willing to change their behavior accordingly. But of course, these aren&#8217;t really solutions at all. Knife-forks are abstract ideas, fantasies that make us feel better about a hypothetical world in which they&#8217;re adopted, but don&#8217;t actually improve the real world in which they&#8217;re not.</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps I&#8217;ve grown cynical, but where I once became excited by knife-forks, they now completely fail to excite me, and sometimes even annoy me. Some people are actually working, inventing chopsticks or something, to improve the real world, not some hypothetical world in which everyone pays more attention to their eating. And distracting them with your knife-forks hampers such progress.</p>\r\n<p>Also, it&#8217;s a bit arrogant. Sure, the world would be a better place if everyone were, like me of course, willing to pay enough attention to their eating to use a knife-fork. But why should they? When presented with a world that refuses to eat with knife-forks, the humble knife-fork enthusiast asks why and starts working on a better utensil that addresses knife-fork problems. The more common arrogant knife-forker dismisses the world as inadequate to appreciate the brilliance of knife-forks.</p>\r\n<p>American politicians are especially fond of knife-forks. Dennis Kucinich adamantly opposed the latest war in a Congress full of war-supporters. Now he can run for President on an \"I was right\" platform, even though he accomplished nothing. George Bush supported spreading democracy in a country unprepared to accept his generous gift. Now he can righteously claim democracy would have flourished if only the world had better supported his brilliant idea.</p>\r\n<p>Technologists are pretty good at knife-forking as well.  Every day there&#8217;s a new website that would eliminate world hunger, if <em>only</em> it had a million or so visitors. And the intersection of technology and politics is even better: sign my petition to demand people with real power start paying attention to internet petitions!</p>\r\n<p>So now when I have great ideas (<a href=\"http://playinghere.com/\">I could organize music events better than MySpace!</a>), I try to ask myself: is this really a knife-fork? Does my great idea require people to fundamentally adjust their lives? Because if the answer is yes, it doesn&#8217;t really matter if I&#8217;ve just come up with a cure for cancer (I&#8217;ve got one too: avoid all known carcinogens). <em>If the world doesn&#8217;t accept a great idea, it&#8217;s not a great idea.</em> It&#8217;s just a knife-fork. Put it in the drawer, and get back to work making something the world will appreciate.

I&#8217;ve signed up for every email list I could find and attended every meeting loosely related to what I find interesting on the interwebs. But frankly, Denver&#8217;s web community is boring me. I haven&#8217;t found a single person playing with iPhone web interfaces nor the Wii JavaScript API nor microformats nor OpenID nor anyone who went to BarCampDenver last year. And few even know what these things are.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lack of interest in any of those specific trends is not itself a problem. They may all turn out to be just passing fads. But I think these are symptoms of a larger problem: <em>Denver web geekery is not a creative industry; it\'s a manufacturing industry</em>. There&#8217;s an important difference between a web manufacturer, someone who churns out sites on an assembly line schedule using the exact same tools over and over again, and a web artisan, someone who takes the time to investigate, compare, and understand those tools, could maybe <a href=\"http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/LeakyAbstractions.html\">fix them when they break</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I want to be in the latter camp, not least because the former camp is being gradually replaced by increasingly automated tools. The manufacturing industry is not a sustainable career path; robots can manufacture. The plethora of web-related jobs and scarcity of candidates (I&#8217;m seeking a new coworker, by the way) in Denver is, I think, another symptom of this problem. The jobs are open because they&#8217;re unappealing. They&#8217;re boring, low-paying, and bound for obsolescence. Just as monoculture is bad for biological communities, it&#8217;s bad for this industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#8217;s my theory anyway. So what should I do about it? I&#8217;m still trying to figure that out, but when I suggested to the <a href=\"http://webdesign.meetup.com/18/\">Denver web design MeetUp</a> that once a month meetings wasn&#8217;t enough, some good ideas came up.

This is the first album I&#8217;ve bought through traditional channels for about ten years. That&#8217;s when I pretty much stopped buying music. I\'ve bought a few dozen songs directly from independent musicians, but nothing from the recording industry.</p>\r\n<p>Ten years ago the recording industry wasn&#8217;t yet extorting money from music fans, but it was already on the wrong side of things. Specifically, it was still pushing the physical distribution model for music (e.g. <abbr title=\"Compact Discs\">CDs</abbr>) even though digital music was clearly the way forward. So I stopped buying <abbr title=\"Compact Discs\">CDs</abbr> and started waiting for the opportunity to buy digital files instead. And amazingly enough, that opportunity took <em>ten full years</em> to arrive.</p>\r\n<p>&#8220;What about iTunes?&#8221; you ask. Well, until very recently, you couldn&#8217;t buy digital files via iTunes. Because of what is known as \"digital rights management\" or DRM, iTunes really only sells a temporary license to listen to music under very specific circumstances. I&#8217;ve always found that unacceptable.</p>\r\n<p>Before digital music arrived, I could take a <abbr title=\"Compact Disc\">CD</abbr> I bought and give it to my friend to listen to. I can likewise take a car I bought and give it to my friend to drive, or &#8212; to use a metaphor you&#8217;ve likely heard before a movie &#8212; take a candy bar I bought and let my friend taste it. I can generally use my purchases wherever I want and however I want, because they&#8217;re mine. In this light, music files with DRM are not mine at all. How I use them is heavily regulated by whoever sold them. So I&#8217;ve never &#8220;bought&#8221; them.</p>\r\n<p>Before I stopped buying music I bought probably an average of two <abbr title=\"Compact Discs\">CDs</abbr> a month. So over ten years, that&#8217;s about 240 albums I haven&#8217;t bought. That may not be enough for the music industry to miss me, but it&#8217;s enough that I&#8217;ve missed the music industry.

Now that I can finally buy music files and own them, I&#8217;m buying music again. I&#8217;m sure the music industry looks at this as regaining me as a consumer, but I look at it as regaining them as a vendor. I&#8217;ve been sitting around online waiting for them to sell me music for <em>ten years</em> and they just finally showed up with something to sell. So welcome back, music.</p>','2007-09-29 14:19:44'),(960,'No Time to Write','<p>I didn&#8217;t realize I hadn&#8217;t written anything here since September until I read it in <a href=\"http://www.sidewalktheory.com/node/399\">a post by my brother Kevin</a>. I would have responded earlier, but I&#8217;ve been kind of busy lately, as Kevin well knows, since he&#8217;s been making me busy. Specifically, I&#8217;ve been buying a house, starting a company, and trying to hire a coworker while doing the excess work I need a coworker to share at my day job. Before explaining why I think Kevin is only half-right about his theory that bloggers are looking for better jobs, I should probably explain some of that.</p>\r\n<p>Let&#8217;s start with the house. Kevin and Jackie came to Denver last November and stayed with Jessica and I for a couple weeks while they looked for, and until they could get into, their new apartment. While walking their dog around the block, they noticed the triplex just behind our current rental duplex is for sale. I think Jackie jokingly said something like &#8220;we could all buy that and move there.&#8221; After talking about it a bit more, it didn&#8217;t seem so ridiculous. So we started looking at different multi-unit housing for sale around Denver.</p>\r\n<p>I don&#8217;t even know how many places we&#8217;ve looked at by now, but it&#8217;s a lot. We just made our first offer on a place yesterday, and we should get a counter-offer in another hour or two today. The specific house we&#8217;re offering to buy is&#8230; wait for it&#8230; the one just behind our current rental. We&#8217;ll know soon if we&#8217;re buying that or continuing to look.</p>\r\n<p>So now the company. While Kevin and Jackie were between jobs, and to a lesser extent since they&#8217;ve both found jobs around Denver, they&#8217;ve spent a lot of time helping out with <a href=\"http://playinghere.com/\">Playing Here</a>. As a result, the site is crazy busy now, which means it takes even more work to maintain. So now we need more people to do this work, and &#8212; lacking volunteers &#8212; we need to pay these people. To do that, we need an actual company with a tax ID and limited liability and a business bank account and whatnot. So now we have all that as Make Data Make Sense, LLC, as well as a vague business plan for sustaining and growing the site. We should know in the next six months or so whether or not this plan will work out.</p>\r\n<p>So I&#8217;ve been looking at houses and working on Playing Here most nights and weekends. By day, I continue to work as a web developer at <a href=\"http://integer.com/\">The Integer Group</a>, which I can&#8217;t link to without disclaiming that I didn&#8217;t make the website. Since I last wrote here, I&#8217;ve lost two part-time coworkers, which sucked because I&#8217;d only been less than six months and suddenly I was responsible for everything web related. But I&#8217;ve been working on some fun projects and it looks like I&#8217;ll have another co-worker or two soon. This will be my first experience as the senior member of a team, so that should be interesting.</p>\r\n<p>So back to Kevin&#8217;s suggestion that bloggers are looking for better jobs. I think that&#8217;s only true to the extent that people looking for better jobs have time to write, either because they&#8217;re unemployed or because they don&#8217;t have enough interest in their current jobs to spend any more time than necessary on that. Bloggers are just people who have time to write. I wrote about this about 4 years ago (back when I didn&#8217;t bother with capitalization) in <cite><a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2003/09/04/because_i_have_ample_free_time/#content\">because i have ample free time</a></cite>. Specifically, I said:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>what makes bloggers more elite? having computers for one. and having free time to read and write. heck, having electricity. what doesn\'t make bloggers more <a href=\"http://www.globalrichlist.com/\">elite</a>? doc\'s suggestion that \"it doesn\'t take ample free time\" is simply not true. it <em>does</em> take ample free time.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>I still think that&#8217;s true. And while people looking for jobs is one group that has ample free time, other groups include professional writers (e.g. Doc Searls) and students. I started blogging as a student, but I continued blogging through my first several jobs out of college, up until this one. And while I do like my current job more than any previous job, I also liked my previous job more than any before that. I wasn&#8217;t really looking for this job when it appeared, so that&#8217;s not why I kept writing.</p>\r\n<p>But why did I keep writing then and stop just recently? I think there are several factors, but the main one is that I wasn&#8217;t as busy when I was writing as I am now. But with everything making me busy promising to come to some resolution relatively soon, it looks likely I&#8217;ll be less busy soon, so maybe I&#8217;ll start writing more again, even though I still won&#8217;t be looking for a better job.</p>','2008-02-03 15:59:27'),(961,'The Geese','<p>I saw the geese again on my way to work today, ambling across the otherwise busy street.

I think it\'s the absurdity of the situation that makes me laugh. It wouldn\'t amuse me so in the country.

Most people who know me say I have bad memory, but I found out today I don&#8217;t. I only have bad <em>episodic</em> memory. My <em>semantic</em> memory is just fine, perhaps even exceptionally good. According to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_memory#Location_of_semantic_memory_in_the_brain\">some scientists referenced on Wikipedia</a>, the hippocampus is a section of the brain that handles episodic memory, and does not handle semantic memory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My hippocampus also handles my sense direction. I don&#8217;re remember having better episodic memory ten years ago, but I do remember having a better sense of direction. And I also don&#8217;t remember my bad memory being a defining trait ten years ago, so I&#8217;m assuming it was okay at some point and then it went bad. Damage to my hippocampus would explain this.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Episodic memory is the kind of memory your friends notice you not having. You forget that time you went on that trip together, or what they told you yesterday, or some other episode that defines your friendship. You&#8217;re still a nice guy, just kind of insensitive. This is me. Except I&#8217;m not insensitive (I swear!); these things just don&#8217;t stick in my brain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think semantic memory, on the other hand, is commonly misunderstood as intelligence. People who know me tend to think I&#8217;m &#8220;smart,&#8221; but I really just have good semantic memory. I pick up programming concepts or games quickly because they are inherently semantic. Every part has a defined <em>meaning</em>. But I don&#8217;t remember the episode of learning the concepts. They just become part of my mental model of the world, my semantic memory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So assuming I&#8217;m correct that my hippocampus was damaged, what might have caused that? <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Episodic_memory#Episodic_memory_damage\">Other scientists referenced on Wikipedia</a> say it might have something to do with autism and/or maybe Alzheimer&#8217;s. You&#8217;ll recall I once <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2005/03/20/Asperger\'s/\">diagnosed myself as having Asperger&#8217;s</a>, a mild form of autism. And <a href=\"http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/09/070926113835.htm\">Alzheimer&#8217;s increasingly seems to be a kind of diabeties in the brain</a>, interesting here because I am diabetic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a less scientific-sounding explanation, there was that one time I jumped into a doorway and hit my head so hard I had to be taken to the emergency room. I don&#8217;t actual remember that episode, but the story of that episode is essentially the meaning of the scar on my forehead. (See the distinction there?) That happened within the timeframe I suspect my hippocampus was damaged. But the location of the hippocampus (near the center of the brain) makes that seem less plausible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or maybe my hippocampus wasn&#8217;t damaged at all. Maybe I always had bad episodic memory and just don&#8217;t remember it when I was younger. That would, of course, make sense.

The BBC says:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>\"Caffeine appears to block several of the disruptive effects of cholesterol that make the blood-brain barrier leaky,\" said Dr Jonathan Geiger, who led the study.</p>\r\n<p>\"High levels of cholesterol are a risk factor for Alzheimer\'s disease, perhaps by compromising the protective nature of the blood brain barrier.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>This caught my attention. I never drank coffee, but I did stop drinking soft drinks about ten years ago, at the same time I stopped eating meat. In addition to saving money, I always thought this was an obviously healthy thing to do.

I often half-jokingly say that I don&#8217;t like animals and I&#8217;m vegetarian because I want to eat their food source and starve them to death. This is only half-joking because starvation would be a natural, reasonable way for animals to die. Industrial meat farming, on the other hand, just doesn&#8217;t make any sense. There are a lot of things I still eat that also don&#8217;t make sense, but industrial meat is an extreme. It&#8217;s a clear aberration in the history of food, and I want nothing to do with it.</p>\r\n<p>I part with Ezra here:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>&#8230; As living things, [animals] deserve not to be managed strictly as food items. They deserve to eat a diet that their digestion is adapted for, rather than one that fattens them up. (If they are meat-eaters, they deserve to eat other living things, rather than the ground bones of other industrially-farmed animals, which is commonly used as feed.) They deserve to roam, to graze&#8212;to follow their behaviors. The industrial system puts the animals in an extremely tight cycle of birth, feeding, waste removal, and slaughter, which is not a life.</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>My own vegetarianism is more selfish. I don&#8217;t think animals deserve any of this, but I do think <em>I</em> deserve to live in a world where animals are treated like, well, the animals they are. The industrial meat industry (and the meat-rich diet that sustain it) upsets me in the same way someone claiming that 2 + 2 = 5 upsets me. It obviously doesn&#8217;t work, and I want my world to work.</p>\r\n<p>Nature will acquiesce to most of our modern attempts to bypass it. Our highways through mountains, our televised realities, our internets all infringe on the way the world has optimized itself to work. But industrialized meat goes too far, rearranging the way life itself works. This can&#8217;t last. Nature will not adapt to this; it will give us mad cow diseases until <em>we</em> adapt. That doesn&#8217;t mean everyone has to be vegetarian, but we will have to eat much less meat. My vegetarianism is a proof-of-concept that this is still possible, that we can still back out of the broken food cycle we&#8217;ve created.</p>','2008-04-11 06:55:26'),(966,'Live Through This','<p>Back in university I had a lot of artsy friends. One of these friends, Sabrina Chapadjiev, got a bunch of artsy people together in a group to make some art. I played music and had long hair, but I&#8217;ve never really considered myself very artsy. When my theatre friends needed help with a play, I ran the audio equipment. But when Sabrina wrote a play, I somehow ended up in it. It wasn&#8217;t a major part, but I was on stage, which was uncomfortable. The play, called <cite>Perhaps Merely Quiet</cite>, became even more uncomfortable a couple days before it opened, when I discovered that it was largely autobiographical. That probably surprised me more than everyone else, since it was really kind of foolish of me to not have assumed from the beginning it was at least somewhat related to the writer&#8217;s life.</p>\r\n<p>I gather from <a href=\"http://sabrinachap.com/theatrepage.htm\">Sabrina&#8217;s website</a> that the play has changed a bit since the initial production, but the key theme of madness has remained. So amidst the chaos that always exists around a theatre production, to find out the director is to some extent using the play to recreate her own past madness, well, I found the experience somewhat disturbing. I really didn&#8217;t want to be responsible for helping someone self-destruct, and I had no idea if that&#8217;s what was happening. So after the play was done, I tried to stay away from that whole scene, which meant mostly staying away from Sabrina.</p>\r\n<p>I still have friends who have maintained contact with Sabrina, though, so I&#8217;ve heard a little of what she&#8217;s been doing. She seems to have become a somewhat successful artist, notwithstanding my earlier concerns. And now she has a book, called <cite>Live Through This</cite>, available to <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Live-Through-This-Creativity-Self-Destruction/dp/1583228276/\">pre-order via Amazon</a>. The subtitle of the book is &#8220;On Creativity and Self-Destruction,&#8221; exactly what I was worried about back then. Somehow binding it up in a book makes it seem less scary and more impressive, though. I don&#8217;t have any of the same worries that this book will have some sort of harmful effect on anyone.</p>\r\n<p>It doesn&#8217;t hurt that the book includes a list of prestigious contributors. Remember when I wrote <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2007/01/14/Movement/#content\">about bell hooks</a>? She&#8217;s one of the contributors to Sabrina&#8217;s book. So in my small world this makes Sabrina successful. Of course she was probably successful long ago, back when I knew her even, but I just realized it.

Since I last wrote here, I bought a house, got a new job, and a new (to me) car. The car didn&#8217;t change much, but the house feels like a very adult responsibility and the job feels like something I&#8217;ll do for a while. Life all seems very settled now, no longer the tumult of youth. Suddenly I&#8217;m old.</p>\r\n<p>Several of my university friends were philosophy majors. I was not, and know very little about schools of thought on big issues, so I&#8217;m sure much of what I have to say has been said more precisely. But I have some ideas on life and whatnot and those that haven\'t changed much over the past two decades are likely to stick with me through the rest of this, so I thought I should write them down, a sort of ongoing <a href=\"http://thisibelieve.org/\">This I Believe</a>.</p>\r\n<p>Trying to begin at what seems relatively like a beginning, my first idea, a principle to guide my other ideas, is that one&#8217;s ideas should be internally consistent. We call someone a \"hypocrite\" if they claim to believe something they really don&#8217;t, but I&#8217;m not sure we have a word for someone who believes two things that can not possibly both be true.</p>\r\n<p>For example, some people will claim taxes are always bad while secretly valuing government programs paid for by taxes, possibly for political gain. And these people are hypocrites. But other people truly believe taxes are always bad, and truly value government programs paid for by taxes, and just don&#8217;t recognize the contradiction.</p>\r\n<p>Some of them just don&#8217;t think about it enough to establish the contradiction. We might call them \"lazy thinkers\" or something to that effect. But what I want to focus on, as the antithesis of where I&#8217;m starting, is a whole different class of thinking that believes taxes are always bad, values government programs paid for by taxes, sees the contradiction there, but sees no problem in contradiction.</p>\r\n<p>I don&#8217;t know how to engage such thought. I can&#8217;t even say inconsistency is \"bad,\" because bad implies some sort of internally-consistent value judgment. \"Confounding\" is probably the best word I can come up with to describe the antithesis of how I want to approach ideas. Ideas should be consistent, not confounding.</p>\r\n<p>I feel a bit like Walter Sobchak in <a href=\"http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118715/\">The Big Lebowski</a>, when he says <q>Nihilists! Fuck me. I mean, say what you like about the tenets of National Socialism, Dude; at least it\'s an ethos.</q> The thing is, I think Nihilism is still better than confounding. Say what you like about the lack of tenets of Nihilism; at least they&#8217;re consistent.</p>\r\n<p>So I&#8217;m starting with consistency as a base. I don&#8217;t really have any justification for that; I just don&#8217;t know how to think without it. If anything after seems inconsistent, I hope someone will point it out.</p>','2010-01-10 20:25:57'),(974,'Reality','<p>I think the obvious next step beyond a set of ideas being <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2010/01/10/Consistency/#content\">internally consistent</a> is keeping those ideas consistent with the universe. For better or worse, the universe is our context, and it doesn&#8217;t seem to much care for debate on how it works. I may think it would be really great if I could live forever, but reality suggests I can&#8217;t, so I shouldn&#8217;t grow attached the the idea of immortality.</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, the universe is full of change, so holding ideas consistent with reality necessitates holding a lot of conditional ideas. It&#8217;s good to go outside and get some sun, until the sun becomes a cause of cancer. Being consistent with the universe doesn&#8217;t mean siding with the sun and getting cancer; it means recognizing the risk of cancer and not going in the sun so much.</p>\r\n<p>Even a principle as abstract as consistency with the universe already suggests to me some immediate implications for practical decisions. Accepting consistency with the universe as a virtue means avoiding any long-term escapism, e.g. heavy drug use, immersive fiction, or - most extreme - suicide.</p>\r\n<p>Escapism is certainly appealing; the universe can be harsh. For some people, I can imagine it&#8217;s so harsh that they just can&#8217;t make it work. But because it&#8217;s nowhere near that difficult for me, even in my most self-pitying moments, any escape will be temporary. And when it ends, when I go back to facing reality, the escape will prove regrettable, a missed opportunity, a procrastination.</p>\r\n<p>A procrastination from what, I have no idea. I don&#8217;t know where the universe is heading, or even if it has a direction. But it&#8217;s going to take me along whether I like it or not, so I might as well appreciate the experiences, even the most difficult, as much as I can.</p>\r\n<p>So to review: I&#8217;d like my ideas to not contradict each other, nor to contradict reality.

Until someone makes that (or points me to it, if I&#8217;ve missed it), I&#8217;ll be using my blog.</p>\r\n<p>There are a whopping 10 candidates for Mayor this year. I&#8217;m not sure how the ordering works, but on my ballot, they are in this order: Doug Linkhart, Carol Boigon, Chris Romer, Thomas Andrew Wolf, James Mejia, Jeff Peckman, Theresa Spahn, Michael B. Hancock, Danny F. Lopez, and Ken Simpson. Romer is the only name that sounds familiar, and I&#8217;m not sure why, so I&#8217;m going into this with close to a blank slate. Let&#8217;s pull up the websites.</p>\r\n<p>Right off the bat, I&#8217;m eliminating <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Peckman\">Peckman</a> as a choice. Turns out he&#8217;s the guy who pushed for some sort of government alien welcome committee. Even if that were an especially reasonable issue, I&#8217;m not voting for someone who only cares about a single issue.</p>\r\n<p>After that, there&#8217;s only one candidate who doesn&#8217;t seem to have a website: Ken Simpson. I&#8217;d be willing to look past that if the <a href=\"http://blogs.westword.com/latestword/2011/03/ken_simpson_denver_mayors_race_profile.php\">Westword</a> article suggested he&#8217;s especially good, but it doesn&#8217;t. On his top issue, jobs, he&#8217;s quoted as saying <q>Atlanta, Minneapolis and Austin always seem to be getting companies to come to them, and I don&#8217;t know why.</q> Maybe learn why first, <em>then</em> run for mayor.</p>\r\n<p>So now I have 8 websites to look at. At a quick glance, 2 of those sites look like they&#8217;re not very serious: <a href=\"http://www.wolf4denvermayor.com/\">Wolf</a> has a number in his domain, a title of \"Home Page\", and what appears to be a free hosting icon at the bottom. Nope. <a href=\"http://www.dannyflopezformayor.com/\">Danny Lopez</a> has the domain name as a title, some terrible graphics, and starts with \"I am the Real Deal.\" Nothing says \"I am not the real deal\" like starting your pitch with \"I am the real deal.\"</p>\r\n<p>Now I&#8217;m looking at 6 mayoral candidates who are at least serious enough to get a decent website put together: <a href=\"http://www.douglinkhart.net/\">Linkhart</a>, <a href=\"http://boigonfordenver.com/\">Boigon</a>, <a href=\"http://romerformayor.com/\">Romer</a>, <a href=\"http://www.mejiaformayor.com/\">Mejia</a>, <a href=\"http://spahnformayor.com/\">Spahn</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.hancockformayor.com/\">Hancock</a>. Time to look at issues. All 6 are talking about the economy and jobs. Boigon is the only one who doesn&#8217;t really say anything specific, so -1 there. Linkhart seems big into cutting services, so -1 there.</p>\r\n<p>Beyond jobs, everyone but Boigon talks about being \"green\" or sustainability. So another -1 for Boigon. Let&#8217;s go ahead and focus on the other 5. Next issue: education. And ... everyone sounds pretty similar. That&#8217;s about it for issues at the city level. I did notice Romer has a section on LGBT equality, and while that isn&#8217;t especially relevant for Mayor, it&#8217;s nice to see he&#8217;s not afraid to say the right thing without an obvious political advantage.</p>\r\n<p>Let&#8217;s move on to experience. Linkhart was on City Council. Romer was in the State Senate. Mejia was on School Board. Spahn was a judge. Hancock was City Council President. So they&#8217;re all experienced, but Romer and Spahn are the only two with political experience outside Denver. That suggests they&#8217;re looking at a future beyond Mayor, which seems good to me because they&#8217;ll need to be relatively popular as Mayor to successfully move on to anything else.</p>\r\n<p>Next up: endorsements. Linkhart has a bunch of names. I guess that would be okay if he had larger endorsements too, but he doesn&#8217;t. So Linkhart&#8217;s off my list. Romer was endorsed by the Denver Post. Mejia was endorsed by AFSCME, a large union. Spahn was endorsed by a State Representative, who was apparently her 7th grade teacher. That&#8217;s less than impressive. I think I&#8217;ll take Spahn off the list. Hancock, like Linkhart, was endorsed by a bunch of names I don&#8217;t recognize. Maybe he wasn&#8217;t popular as City Council President?</p>\r\n<p>At this point, I&#8217;m looking at Romer or Mejia. I suspect Romer will win, as everything about his website suggests he has the best campaign. And I&#8217;m okay with Romer winning; he looks like he&#8217;ll be a pretty good Mayor. But I&#8217;m going to vote for Mejia, because I don&#8217;t expect him to win. It&#8217;s not that I want to support the underdog; I just think closer elections keep politicians thinking about their constituencies, and that will result in better government. If Romer wins 30% over Mejia&#8217;s 29%, I expect he&#8217;ll be a better major than if he won with over 50% of the vote. And if Mejia ends up winning, I&#8217;m okay with that too.</p>','2011-04-17 16:17:12'),(977,'Denver Mayor 2011: My Second Vote','<p>My <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2011/04/17/Denver_Mayor_2011%3A_My_Vote/#content\">voting strategy</a> in Denver\'s Mayoral race worked much better than I imagined. My thinking was that Romer would win, and I should vote for someone else who seemed good, to keep Romer accountable. What I didn&#8217;t realize is Denver&#8217;s mayoral elections require a majority, not just a plurality. So Romer didn&#8217;t actually win by a small margin; he didn&#8217;t win at all. He did get the most votes. Mejia, who I expected to take second, actually took third slightly behind Hancock. So the runoff is <a href=\"http://www.denverpost.com/politics/ci_17996062\">between Romer and Hancock</a>. I didn&#8217;t pay much attention to Hancock the first time, and looking more closely at him now, I don&#8217;t like him as much as Romer. Specifically his suggestion to set \"performance goals\" for city agencies feels like an empty gesture at best, an opening to cuts based on the ability to quantify rather than actual importance at worst. So unless something significant changes before the runoff, I&#8217;m voting for Romer this time.</p>','2011-05-05 19:13:38'),(978,'Remembering the Bear Attack','<img src=\"/image/article/content/bear_attack.jpg\" alt=\"bear attack\" style=\"float: right; margin: 0 0 1em 2em;\" />\r\n<p>One of my group of friends sent us all a picture of a bear attack we experienced together a few years ago.</p>\r\n<p>That\'s me on the far right of the picture, in the background. I say \"a few years ago\" because I don&#8217;t remember how many years it was. Somewhere around three, I think. I don&#8217;t remember this moment at all, actually. This is a good demonstration of how my memory works, or rather doesn&#8217;t. This was clearly a memorable moment, but I don&#8217;t remember it. I&#8217;m sure it was fun. I imagine someone (maybe even me) saw this giant bear statue, and somehow we arrived at the idea to pose for a picture of the bear attacking us.</p>\r\n<p>Are there bears in North Dakota? Maybe we talked about that at the time. I feel like we talked about some other kind of attack in North Dakota. Maybe scorpions?</p>\r\n<p>I remember a lot of the context around this photo. This was at our friends&#8217; wedding in North Dakota, just before the ceremony. Or just before something with a set time anyway. Maybe between the ceremony and the reception? We had some time to kill before that set time, and we were at a resort with mini golf, so we played mini golf. Toward the end of the mini golf, we realized we had to hurry up, so we started playing collaboratively rather than competitively. We all worked together hitting all the balls toward the next hold, calling it \"communist mini golf.\" Was the beat at the end or in the middle? We probably didn&#8217;t have time for a photo at the end.</p>\r\n<p>It&#8217;s possible I only remember the communist mini golf part because Jessica mentions it pretty much every time we play mini golf. I also remember the reception was at a building a short walk from the mini golf. There were swings in between. And basketball. I think we played basketball at some point, maybe some other game as well. Four square? Where did we get a ball? The reception had an upstairs patio where people could smoke. People did smoke, and I joined them to talk. I don&#8217;t remember which people smoked. Either the night before or the night of the bear attack in this photo, I was outside, it was dark, and I was talking to someone. About something.</p>\r\n<p>My implicit memory is great. I can do things I\'ve done before, with skills I don&#8217;t remember learning. Much of life is like riding a bike for me, where you never really forget how. But my episodic memory is awful. I frequently start watching a new movie only to realize after five or ten minutes that I&#8217;ve actually seen it before. So maybe it&#8217;s like riding a bike, but I&#8217;m unsure if it&#8217;s my bike or I maybe borrowed it.</p>\r\n<p>In many ways, as you might imagine, this is a bad way to go through life. I can&#8217;t reminisce with my friends about the bear attack; without memory, I effectively wasn&#8217;t there. But there I am, in the photo. Clearly I <em>was</em> there. It&#8217;s easy for people to assume from my lack of memory that I didn&#8217;t enjoy such shared moments. I&#8217;m pretty sure I did here. I look happy, of course, but beyond that, this is the kind of experience I <em>would</em> enjoy. Or at least I would now. Was I different then? Surely I enjoyed it.</p>\r\n<p>In other ways, bad episodic memory is a gift. Unlike all my friends, I can look at this photo and experience it anew. While they can only remember their actual experience, I can construct new experiences among the wide gaps in my memory. It&#8217;s almost as if I get to relive my life, with only a few boundaries that I must repeat, in the memories I retain. Everyone looks happy in photos, so there&#8217;s a good chance my reconstructed past is actually happier than it was the first time around.</p>\r\n<p>I&#8217;ve never met anyone with memory like mine. I&#8217;m pretty sure my memory wasn&#8217;t always like this, and I didn&#8217;t realize it had changed until years later, when I couldn&#8217;t very much remember years before. I&#8217;m sure there are other people with similar memories. Similar memory <em>capacities</em>, I mean. I doubt there are other people who remember the bear attack like I do. I can&#8217;t tell you how much fun we had.</p>','2011-05-16 18:38:39'),(979,'Online Identity','<p>On <a href=\"http://lettersunknown.com/archives/001643.html\">Letters to an Unknown Audience</a>, Ezra Kilty, whose trouser size is 31 x 33, quotes a passage from <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Master-Commander-Patrick-OBrian/dp/0393307050\">Master and Commander</a>, ending with a paragraph on identity:</p>\r\n<blockquote><p>\"The identity I am thinking of is something that hovers between a man and the rest of the world: a mid-point between his view of himself and their of himâ€”for each, of course, affects the other continually. ...\"</p></blockquote>\r\n<p>That seems true and I\'m particularly interested in how this plays out online, perhaps because that is my primary mid-point. My brother, whose trouser size I do not know, once wrote something about how people stop blogging when they get jobs. I think he wrote it on a blog he later stopped writing when he got a job. It may be more indirect than that; people stop blogging when they have enough interaction to establish identity. That may be a job, but it could just as easily be a knitting circle.</p>\r\n<p>These things take time from a day, and that\'s what I\'ve always thought was driving the change. You get a job, and you don\'t have time to blog. But maybe it\'s more than that. Maybe you know on some level that when you don\'t interact with others, you stop existing in their minds. You feel yourself start to lose identity. So you go online and make your self known there. On a blog maybe, or a social networking site, or in videos, or as an avatar in some game. The context doesn\'t really matter. The point is: you are a person who acts a certain way and now other people know such a person exists. You gain identity.</p>\r\n<p>It\'s difficult to have a good identity through interaction. Society is rigged against doing. We recognize good deeds, sins of commission, and sins of omission, but almost never good deeds of omission. You noticed when I failed to say \"happy birthday\" on Facebook but not when I stopped myself from posting that mean-spirited comment on YouTube. No one applauds the politicians who just do their jobs and somehow avoid attacking each other. We even vote such people out of office when someone else with more identity comes along.</p>\r\n<p>It\'s also difficult to have a consistent identity, but that may be a good thing. Too much consistency makes it difficult to change, and we all need to change. On <a href=\"http://www.ftrain.com/woods-plus.html\">Ftrain</a>, Paul Ford writes that Google+ <q>lets you divide people into clusters and lie to each group in different ways.</q> As negative as that sounds, it brings online identity closer to physical interaction. It\'s much easier to establish myself as patient in my knitting circle and efficient in my job when I don\'t have to mix the two. Surely this can be taken to Jekyll/Hyde extremes, but it seems we need at least some ambiguity to successfully navigate identity.</p>\r\n<p>Ezra closed his post by saying <q>I am sharing this with you.</q> That didn\'t mean much to me at first, but I now find I\'m inclined to say something similar in ending this, to establish my own identity by affecting your view of me. As much as I can influence it, I want my identity to be good, but also somewhat fluid. I am a person who has thought about these things.</p>','2011-07-17 09:35:32'),(980,'Words, Which are Important','<p>I haven&#8217;t been paying much attention to <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupy_Wall_Street\">Occupy Wall Street</a>. It initially looked to me like the kind of disorganized protest that happens all the time, doesn&#8217;t have enough focus, and quickly dissipates when anarchists show up to co-opt the whole thing. But now that it has successfully sustained itself for a couple weeks, it&#8217;s clear my initial perception was wrong. Today I noticed they&#8217;ve released their first <a href=\"http://nycga.cc/2011/09/30/declaration-of-the-occupation-of-new-york-city/\">official statement</a>, and I read through it, thinking it would give me a better idea of who this group is and what they hope to accomplish.</p>\r\n<p>The <a href=\"http://nycga.cc/2011/09/29/general-assembly-minutes-929-7pm/\">minutes of the meeting that agreed to this document</a> are fascinating. They ended a long discussion of this document by saying (shouting?) <q>THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRACY LOOKS LIKE!</q> and it really does look like a working democracy. The meeting minutes are probably more useful for understanding the group than the official statement. It&#8217;s really impressive they&#8217;ve been able to hold this together so long without much formal leadership at all, and it&#8217;s exciting to be able to see the details of how that works in practice.</p>\r\n<p>That said, the document itself isn&#8217;t great. It does very little to clarify what exactly the group is about, at least for someone like myself who is vaguely sympathetic. It&#8217;s just a long list of bad things corporations have done. The key question I had before reading it went entirely unanswered: is this group against corporations themselves, some general category of corporate behavior, or an unrelated collection of specific corporate misdeeds? It looks like the group itself hasn&#8217;t answered this question. I imagine there are more than a few dedicated communists in the group as well as people who maintain a generally positive view of corporations.</p>\r\n<p>I mention all of this as context for a single word in this statement, which seems to exemplify where this group is right now. Emphasis added:</p>\r\n<blockquote>We come to you at a time when corporations, <strong>which</strong> place profit over people, self-interest over justice, and oppression over equality, run our governments.</blockquote>\r\n<p>I\'d speculate most adults in America don&#8217;t know when to use \"which\" and when to use \"that.\" But surely at least one person in the working group that created this document understood the difference. Unfortunately the meeting at which this document was drafted has no published minutes to tell us if they collectively considered an alternative:</p>\r\n<blockquote>We come to you at a time when corporations <strong>that</strong> place profit over people, self-interest over justice, and oppression over equality, run our governments.</blockquote>\r\n<p>That single word change is pretty big. The published version suggests all corporations place oppression over equality. The alternative would say only <em>some</em> corporations do that, specifically those running our government. That single word is the difference between a campaign against corporate influence of government and a campaign against the very existence of corporations at all. Outside this statement, I don&#8217;t see much evidence Occupy Wall Street has defined its position on this issue. But here in this statement, they may have done so unintentionally.</p>\r\n<p>I think we&#8217;re in good shape on the question of what democracy looks like. Is it too early to start worrying about what democracy writes like?</p>','2011-10-02 10:05:19'),(981,'Since I Last Wrote','<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" lang=\"en\">\r\n<p>And the longer you donâ€™t keep a public update, the bigger backlog you have to work through. â€œSince I last wrote â€¦ everything changed.â€ Hmm.</p>\r\n&#8212; Scott Reynen (@scottr) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/scottr/statuses/436069628251361280\">February 19, 2014</a>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<script async=\"async\" src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\r\n<p>That was in response to &#8220;<a href=\"https://the-pastry-box-project.net/fffunction/2014-February-18\">I don\'t write much anymore</a>&#8221;, which describes a feeling I relate to, but which doesn&#8217;t entirely explain my own lack of writing. And after trying to explain another part of why I don&#8217;t write, I realized it&#8217;s pretty easy to deal with. I&#8217;ll just give you a quick recap and then you&#8217;ll know everything about me. Or at least close enough that I can write again without feeling like you have no idea who the author is.</p>\r\n<p>So let&#8217;s see&#8230; I just adopted a kid. Really <em>just</em>, about a week ago. That&#8217;s new. And my job title is now Vice President. That&#8217;s different. And what else? I stopped writing music for a while, but then I got a piano and now I&#8217;m slowly getting back into music. But maybe not with the kid? Who knows.</p>\r\n<p>I stopped caring much about electoral politics, I think mostly because politicians generally reward caring by asking for more money and I don&#8217;t like to think about how much money has broken democracy. I guess I&#8217;m generally a little less certain about stuff.</p>\r\n<p>Over the last few years, I&#8217;ve thought several times about <a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2010/01/13/Reality/\">a post I once wrote about trying to stay true to reality</a>, which I ended with a question about how we know what is real, and a promise to return to that. I thought at the time I might invest a little time into thinking about that and come up with a good answer, but I still don&#8217;t know.</p>\r\n<p>There&#8217;s something about getting multiple perspectives to fill in missing holes in reality, but how do we know which perspectives are right and which are wrong? I don&#8217;t know. That hasn&#8217;t really changed; I never knew. But now, I also don&#8217;t really care. If the people I&#8217;ve chosen to trust are all wrong and I&#8217;m living in a manufactured reality that is internally consistent but still wrong &#8212; actually, not even <em>if</em>. That&#8217;s almost certainly the case, and I&#8217;m okay with that.</p>\r\n<p>Um, what else? I started buying and selling stocks and it turns out I&#8217;m pretty good at that. Mostly Apple, but others too. I&#8217;ve played a bit with iOS app development. I realized at a concert that I can no longer sit &#8220;indian-style&#8221;, which I just now realized is a potentially offensive term. I&#8217;ll have to look that up.</p>\r\n<p>I realized recently that I can&#8217;t actually read all the blogs I&#8217;m subscribed to, but don&#8217;t really have a solution to that, meaning I still <em>want</em> to be a person who reads them all. Oh, I now help run groups.drupal.org, which combined with my Vice President title at a well-known Drupal-using company gives me a weird sort of authority in the Drupal community, where I still feel like an outsider.</p>\r\n<p>That&#8217;s maybe enough for now. Basically I&#8217;m older and dumber. Maybe I&#8217;ll write more now. But I&#8217;m not making any promises. Because I don&#8217;t know.</p>\r\n<div><i><strong>Update:</strong> Ha, my blog still does XHTML validation. I totally forgot caring about that; I guess that&#8217;s another thing that changed. Took me longer to validate the markup on this post than it did to write it. Maybe I&#8217;ll turn off the validation before I write more.</i></div>','2014-02-19 10:29:37'),(982,'Reality as a Process','<p>A long time ago I proposed &#8220;<a href=\"http://typewriting.org/2010/01/13/Reality/#content\">what exactly is reality?</a>&#8221; as a question I would later answer. More recently I wrote on the same topic &#8220;I donâ€™t know [...] I also donâ€™t really care.&#8221; That was obviously not quite true, as here I am writing about it again. I think what was true was that I\'m okay with not having a way to fully define reality. And I&#8217;m not only okay with the ambiguity of possibly being totally wrong about everything; I think it&#8217;s a good thing.</p>\r\n<p>I remember reading a long time ago <a href=\"http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/620163-the-more-i-learn-the-more-i-realize-how-much\">a quote by Einstein</a> &#8220;The more I learn, the more I realize how much I don\'t know.&#8221; and later hearing about what I think was probably <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dunning%E2%80%93Kruger_effect\">the Dunningâ€“Kruger effect</a>, an actual cognitive confirmation of what Einstein said. Ignorance really does breed overconfidence while knowledge grows understanding of how ignorant we really are. What we value isn&#8217;t just knowing a lot in general, but specifically knowing enough to poke at the edges of what we don&#8217;t know.</p>\r\n<p>There&#8217;s something uncomfortable about recognizing that the part we don&#8217;t know just seems bigger and bigger the more we learn about it. But I think the alternative, the idea that we could figure it all out and just be done learning about the universe, sounds even worse. Maybe it&#8217;s just the perspective of what I know now, but it&#8217;s hard to imagine knowing everything without everything feeling really small and boring.</p>\r\n<p>Once I start from the assumption that reality is undefinable and stop struggling against that idea, reality actually gains some definition, not as a resolvable thing, but rather as the process for improving resolution. I&#8217;d been thinking about reality as a thing to see better, but reality is more like <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vxq9yj2pVWk\">the \"enhance\" thing they do on TV shows</a>, only not totally ridiculous. It&#8217;s the process of seeing better.</p>\r\n<p>So taking that back to the idea that one&#8217;s ideas should be not only internally consistent, but also consistent with external reality, I think all I really mean by that is that being internally consistent can&#8217;t come at the expense of being open to new ideas. That doesn&#8217;t mean all new ideas are equal, because new ideas can be evaluated on how they open up even more new ideas. Bad ideas shut down thought. Good ideas expand it. And expanding ideas includes maintaining a good amount of existing ideas, which conveniently rejects the whole \"everything we know is a dream\" flavor of nihilism. That seems like a pretty good rubric for approaching ideas. I&#8217;m looking forward to applying it more specifically in future posts to see how coherent my thinking really is.</p>','2014-03-12 04:21:48');
